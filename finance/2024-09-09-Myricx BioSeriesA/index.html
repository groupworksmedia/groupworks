This record-breaking investment represents one of the largest early-stage investments in a European academic biotech spinout, capturing the attention of global investors and signalling a pivotal moment for venture capital (VC) in Europe.</p><h3>A Clear Vote of Confidence from Top-Tier Investors</h3><p>The Series A round was spearheaded by two of the most respected names in life sciences VC—Novo Holdings and Abingworth—both known for backing high-impact biotech startups. They were joined by a prestigious group of co-investors, which includes:</p><ul><li><strong>British Patient Capital</strong>, demonstrating public sector support for innovative healthcare ventures.</li><li><strong>Cancer Research Horizons</strong>, reflecting the nonprofit's trust in Myricx’s potential to contribute to cancer research.</li><li><strong>Eli Lilly</strong>, highlighting Big Pharma’s commitment to groundbreaking biotech developments.</li><li><strong>Brandon Capital</strong> and <strong>Sofinnova Partners</strong>, both returning investors, a testament to the company’s progress since earlier funding rounds.</li></ul><p>The wide array of stakeholders involved, from traditional VCs to global pharmaceutical players, underscores the broad appeal and potential of Myricx’s science. This alignment of interests between diverse investors is rare and is a resounding endorsement of the disruptive potential Myricx Bio offers the oncology space.</p><h3>Changing the Face of European Biotech Funding</h3><p>Traditionally, European biotechs have faced significant challenges when raising large-scale financing compared to their American counterparts. However, Myricx’s Series A challenges that notion head-on.</p><p>This record-breaking round showcases the immense potential of European biotech. It's a clear signal that world-class innovation from UK institutions can attract substantial venture capital, competing on a global stage.</p><p>For VCs, this deal is not just about one company—it’s about transforming perceptions of Europe’s biotech sector. Venture capital in Europe has often been viewed as more risk-averse than in the US. But the success of Myricx Bio demonstrates that with the right technology, European startups can attract sizeable funding, signalling a shift in how European biotechs are valued and supported.</p><h3>Pioneering Science Meets Venture Capital Enthusiasm</h3><p>One of the main reasons Myricx Bio attracted such high-profile investors is the innovative approach they’re bringing to cancer therapy. The company's groundbreaking work on antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) is at the forefront of new treatment paradigms. Unlike many oncology platforms, Myricx’s technology targets <strong>N-myristoyltransferase (NMT)</strong>, an enzyme essential for the growth of certain cancer cells.</p><p>This unique mechanism of action provides a fresh avenue for cancer treatment, which has captivated venture capitalists looking for high-potential bets in the crowded oncology space.</p><p>This investment, has potential to reshape the landscape of cancer therapy. The strong support from venture capital partners enables them to push the boundaries of what's possible in ADC development.</p><p>From a venture capital perspective, the potential returns on investment are vast. ADCs have shown enormous promise as next-generation cancer treatments, and a platform that could fundamentally improve their precision and effectiveness is a golden opportunity. The innovative edge and potential scalability of Myricx’s work makes it an attractive prospect for investors keen on transformative science.</p><h3>Scaling Up: From Idea to Impact</h3><p>For venture capitalists, Myricx’s Series A investment goes beyond backing novel science—it’s about fuelling exponential growth. The influx of capital will allow the company to significantly scale its operations, turning cutting-edge academic research into market-ready therapies. Here’s how the funding will be utilised:</p><ol><li><strong>Team Expansion:</strong> From a current headcount of just four, Myricx plans to increase its team to around 15 full-time employees. This will add critical expertise across R&amp;D, regulatory affairs, and business development, all key areas for startups transitioning from discovery to development stages.<ul></ul></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Establishing R&amp;D Facilities:</strong> The company will set up in-house R&amp;D laboratories in London, providing the infrastructure needed to accelerate research into clinical trials.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Advancing Clinical Programs:</strong> Two lead programs are expected to enter clinical trials, with the first Phase 1 trial targeted for early 2026. Investors are particularly eager about the projected timeline for proof-of-concept data in 2027 and 2028, milestones that could dramatically increase Myricx’s valuation and set the stage for future fundraising rounds or strategic partnerships.</li></ol><h3>Catalysing European Biotech and Venture Capital Ecosystems</h3><p>Myricx’s success has implications far beyond the company itself. It represents a catalyst for the broader European biotech ecosystem, demonstrating that substantial early-stage venture capital can be successfully raised for groundbreaking life sciences innovation. This sends a powerful signal to both startups and investors across Europe that the region is ready to support world-class biotech ventures.</p><p>For venture capitalists, this investment sets a new benchmark for what’s possible in European biotech. It proves that Europe is capable of producing companies with the science, leadership, and potential to deliver outsized returns—factors that traditionally attracted more investment dollars to the US.</p><p>The backing of global pharma giant <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> also highlights the growing trend of pharmaceutical companies working more closely with early-stage biotechs, creating new opportunities for VC-backed firms to access the resources and expertise needed for commercial success.</p><h3>A Positive Outlook for the Future</h3><p>As Myricx Bio moves forward, it carries the hopes not only of its investors but also of the wider biotech and VC communities. This funding round is about more than just capital—it’s about credibility, visibility, and momentum. The company’s success could pave the way for further VC investments in European biotech, creating a virtuous cycle of funding, innovation, and commercialisation.</p><p>With this historic Series A, Myricx Bio stands as a symbol of the potential for European startups to make a global impact, attracting high-caliber investors and blazing a trail for others to follow. The intersection of pioneering science and venture capital ambition makes this a moment to celebrate, not just for Myricx, but for European biotech as a whole.</p><p>As we look to the future, it’s clear: European biotech is ready to play on the global stage, and venture capital is there to fuel that rise.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/max-scotthayes">Max Scott-Hayes</a></li><li><a href="/tags/finance">finance</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vc">VC</a></li><li><a href="/tags/biotech">biotech</a></li></ul></article></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="/disqus.js"></script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript></body><body><footer><p><span>Copyright Flavournomics. </span><span>All rights reserved</span></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
