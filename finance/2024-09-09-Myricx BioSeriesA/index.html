This record-breaking in­vest­ment rep­re­sents one of the largest early-stage in­vest­ments in a Eu­ro­pean aca­d­e­mic biotech spin­out, cap­tur­ing the at­ten­tion of global in­vestors and sig­nalling a piv­otal mo­ment for ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) in Eu­rope.</p><h3>A Clear Vote of Confidence from Top-Tier Investors</h3><p>The Se­ries A round was spear­headed by two of the most re­spected names in life sci­ences VC—Novo Hold­ings and Abing­worth—both known for back­ing high-impact biotech star­tups. They were joined by a pres­ti­gious group of co-investors, which in­cludes:</p><ul><li><strong>British Patient Capital</strong>, demonstrating public sector support for innovative healthcare ventures.</li><li><strong>Cancer Research Horizons</strong>, reflecting the nonprofit's trust in Myricx’s potential to contribute to cancer research.</li><li><strong>Eli Lilly</strong>, highlighting Big Pharma’s commitment to groundbreaking biotech developments.</li><li><strong>Brandon Capital</strong> and <strong>Sofinnova Partners</strong>, both returning investors, a testament to the company’s progress since earlier funding rounds.</li></ul><p>The wide ar­ray of stake­hold­ers in­volved, from tra­di­tional VCs to global phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal play­ers, un­der­scores the broad ap­peal and po­ten­tial of Myricx’s sci­ence. This align­ment of in­ter­ests be­tween di­verse in­vestors is rare and is a re­sound­ing en­dorse­ment of the dis­rup­tive po­ten­tial Myricx Bio of­fers the on­col­ogy space.</p><h3>Changing the Face of European Biotech Funding</h3><p>Tra­di­tion­ally, Eu­ro­pean biotechs have faced sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges when rais­ing large-scale fi­nanc­ing com­pared to their Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts. How­ever, Myricx’s Se­ries A chal­lenges that no­tion head-on.</p><p>This record-breaking round show­cases the im­mense po­ten­tial of Eu­ro­pean biotech. It's a clear sig­nal that world-class in­no­va­tion from UK in­sti­tu­tions can at­tract sub­stan­tial ven­ture cap­i­tal, com­pet­ing on a global stage.</p><p>For VCs, this deal is not just about one com­pany—it’s about trans­form­ing per­cep­tions of Eu­rope’s biotech sec­tor. Ven­ture cap­i­tal in Eu­rope has of­ten been viewed as more risk-averse than in the US. But the suc­cess of Myricx Bio demon­strates that with the right tech­nol­ogy, Eu­ro­pean star­tups can at­tract size­able fund­ing, sig­nalling a shift in how Eu­ro­pean biotechs are val­ued and sup­ported.</p><h3>Pioneering Science Meets Venture Capital Enthusiasm</h3><p>One of the main rea­sons Myricx Bio at­tracted such high-profile in­vestors is the in­no­v­a­tive ap­proach they’re bring­ing to can­cer ther­apy. The com­pany's ground­break­ing work on antibody-drug con­ju­gates (ADCs) is at the fore­front of new treat­ment par­a­digms. Un­like many on­col­ogy plat­forms, Myricx’s tech­nol­ogy tar­gets <strong>N-myristoyltransferase (NMT)</strong>, an en­zyme es­sen­tial for the growth of cer­tain can­cer cells.</p><p>This unique mech­a­nism of ac­tion pro­vides a fresh av­enue for can­cer treat­ment, which has cap­ti­vated ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists look­ing for high-potential bets in the crowded on­col­ogy space.</p><p>This in­vest­ment, has po­ten­tial to re­shape the land­scape of can­cer ther­apy. The strong sup­port from ven­ture cap­i­tal part­ners en­ables them to push the bound­aries of what's pos­si­ble in ADC de­vel­op­ment.</p><p>From a ven­ture cap­i­tal per­spec­tive, the po­ten­tial re­turns on in­vest­ment are vast. ADCs have shown enor­mous promise as next-generation can­cer treat­ments, and a plat­form that could fun­da­men­tally im­prove their pre­ci­sion and ef­fec­tive­ness is a golden op­por­tu­nity. The in­no­v­a­tive edge and po­ten­tial scal­a­bil­ity of Myricx’s work makes it an at­trac­tive prospect for in­vestors keen on trans­for­ma­tive sci­ence.</p><h3>Scaling Up: From Idea to Impact</h3><p>For ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists, Myricx’s Se­ries A in­vest­ment goes be­yond back­ing novel sci­ence—it’s about fu­elling ex­po­nen­tial growth. The in­flux of cap­i­tal will al­low the com­pany to sig­nif­i­cantly scale its op­er­a­tions, turn­ing cutting-edge aca­d­e­mic re­search into market-ready ther­a­pies. Here’s how the fund­ing will be utilised:</p><ol><li><strong>Team Expansion:</strong> From a current headcount of just four, Myricx plans to increase its team to around 15 full-time employees. This will add critical expertise across R&amp;D, regulatory affairs, and business development, all key areas for startups transitioning from discovery to development stages.<ul></ul></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Establishing R&amp;D Facilities:</strong> The company will set up in-house R&amp;D laboratories in London, providing the infrastructure needed to accelerate research into clinical trials.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Advancing Clinical Programs:</strong> Two lead programs are expected to enter clinical trials, with the first Phase 1 trial targeted for early 2026. Investors are particularly eager about the projected timeline for proof-of-concept data in 2027 and 2028, milestones that could dramatically increase Myricx’s valuation and set the stage for future fundraising rounds or strategic partnerships.</li></ol><h3>Catalysing European Biotech and Venture Capital Ecosystems</h3><p>Myricx’s suc­cess has im­pli­ca­tions far be­yond the com­pany it­self. It rep­re­sents a cat­a­lyst for the broader Eu­ro­pean biotech ecosys­tem, demon­strat­ing that sub­stan­tial early-stage ven­ture cap­i­tal can be suc­cess­fully raised for ground­break­ing life sci­ences in­no­va­tion. This sends a pow­er­ful sig­nal to both star­tups and in­vestors across Eu­rope that the re­gion is ready to sup­port world-class biotech ven­tures.</p><p>For ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists, this in­vest­ment sets a new bench­mark for what’s pos­si­ble in Eu­ro­pean biotech. It proves that Eu­rope is ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing com­pa­nies with the sci­ence, lead­er­ship, and po­ten­tial to de­liver out­sized re­turns—fac­tors that tra­di­tion­ally at­tracted more in­vest­ment dol­lars to the US.</p><p>The back­ing of global pharma gi­ant <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> also high­lights the grow­ing trend of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies work­ing more closely with early-stage biotechs, cre­at­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties for VC-backed firms to ac­cess the re­sources and ex­per­tise needed for com­mer­cial suc­cess.</p><h3>A Positive Outlook for the Future</h3><p>As Myricx Bio moves for­ward, it car­ries the hopes not only of its in­vestors but also of the wider biotech and VC com­mu­ni­ties. This fund­ing round is about more than just cap­i­tal—it’s about cred­i­bil­ity, vis­i­bil­ity, and mo­men­tum. The com­pany’s suc­cess could pave the way for fur­ther VC in­vest­ments in Eu­ro­pean biotech, cre­at­ing a vir­tu­ous cy­cle of fund­ing, in­no­va­tion, and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p><p>With this his­toric Se­ries A, Myricx Bio stands as a sym­bol of the po­ten­tial for Eu­ro­pean star­tups to make a global im­pact, at­tract­ing high-caliber in­vestors and blaz­ing a trail for oth­ers to fol­low. The in­ter­sec­tion of pi­o­neer­ing sci­ence and ven­ture cap­i­tal am­bi­tion makes this a mo­ment to cel­e­brate, not just for Myricx, but for Eu­ro­pean biotech as a whole.</p><p>As we look to the fu­ture, it’s clear: Eu­ro­pean biotech is ready to play on the global stage, and ven­ture cap­i­tal is there to fuel that rise.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/max-scotthayes">Max Scott-Hayes</a></li><li><a href="/tags/finance">finance</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vc">VC</a></li><li><a href="/tags/biotech">biotech</a></li></ul></article></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="/disqus.js"></script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript></body><body><footer><p><span>Copyright Group Works. </span><span>All rights reserved</span></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
