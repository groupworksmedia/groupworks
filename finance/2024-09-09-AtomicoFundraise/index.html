This mon­u­men­tal achieve­ment not only un­der­scores the re­silience of the Eu­ro­pean VC land­scape but also sig­nals a seis­mic shift in the global tech in­dus­try, po­si­tion­ing Eu­rope as a for­mi­da­ble con­tender on the world stage.</p><h3>A Strategic Dual-Fund Approach: Nurturing Innovation from Seed to IPO</h3><p>Atom­ico's vi­sion­ary fundrais­ing strat­egy splits its new cap­i­tal be­tween two com­ple­men­tary funds:</p><ol><li><strong>Atomico Growth VI</strong>: A whopping $754 million dedicated to propelling companies from Series B to pre-IPO stages, addressing a critical funding gap in the European ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Atomico Venture VI</strong>: A robust $485 million early-stage fund, primarily targeting Series A investments while maintaining flexibility for exceptional seed opportunities.</li></ol><p>This dual-fund ap­proach rep­re­sents a holis­tic vi­sion for sup­port­ing Eu­ro­pean tech, en­sur­ing a con­tin­u­ous pipeline of sup­port from nascent star­tups to industry-defining uni­corns. By cov­er­ing the en­tire spec­trum of a com­pany's growth jour­ney, Atom­ico is po­si­tion­ing it­self as the ul­ti­mate part­ner for am­bi­tious Eu­ro­pean founders.</p><h3>Empowering Europe's Tech Visionaries: A Founder-First Philosophy</h3><p>Niklas Zennström, the leg­endary en­tre­pre­neur be­hind Skype and founder of Atom­ico, ar­tic­u­lates the firm's mis­sion with char­ac­ter­is­tic in­sight: "Eu­ro­pean tech­nol­ogy is com­ing of age. Meet­ing this op­por­tu­nity re­quires am­bi­tion, hus­tle, and com­mit­ment from founders, who need in­vestors with the ex­pe­ri­ence and per­spec­tive to see be­yond mar­ket cy­cles."</p><p>Zennström's words res­onate deeply within the tech com­mu­nity, high­light­ing Atom­ico's unique po­si­tion as a VC firm founded by en­tre­pre­neurs, for en­tre­pre­neurs. This founder-centric ap­proach, com­bined with Atom­ico's vast re­sources and net­work, cre­ates an un­par­al­leled sup­port sys­tem for Eu­rope's most promis­ing tech in­no­va­tors.</p><h3>A Legacy of Success: From Startup to Unicorn</h3><p>Atom­ico's faith in Eu­ro­pean tech is far from blind op­ti­mism – it's grounded in a track record of phe­nom­e­nal suc­cess. With a port­fo­lio span­ning over 155 am­bi­tious teams across 15 Eu­ro­pean coun­tries, Atom­ico has con­sis­tently demon­strated its abil­ity to iden­tify and nur­ture world-changing ideas. The num­bers speak for them­selves: an as­tound­ing 1 in 6 of Atom­ico's port­fo­lio com­pa­nies has achieved uni­corn sta­tus, val­ued at over $1 bil­lion.</p><p>This im­pres­sive hit rate in­cludes early in­vest­ments in fin­tech rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies like Klarna and Stripe, as well as ground­break­ing com­pa­nies across var­i­ous sec­tors. Atom­ico's golden touch has not only gen­er­ated ex­cep­tional re­turns but has also played a cru­cial role in shap­ing the Eu­ro­pean tech land­scape.</p><h3>Investing in Tomorrow: A Glimpse into the Future of Tech</h3><p>The new funds have al­ready made sig­nif­i­cant in­roads, with 21 in­vest­ments across cutting-edge sec­tors that promise to de­fine the fu­ture of tech­nol­ogy:</p><ul><li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>: Zurich-based Lakera is pushing the boundaries of AI security, while Oslo's Strise is revolutionising enterprise intelligence with its AI-powered platform.</li><li><strong>Health Tech</strong>: Stockholm's Neko Health is reimagining preventive healthcare with full-body scans, and Copenhagen's Corti is leveraging AI to save lives in emergency medical situations.</li><li><strong>Enterprise Software</strong>: Berlin's Deeploi is streamlining IT operations for SMEs, and London's Dexory is transforming warehouse management with robotics and AI.</li><li><strong>Fintech</strong>: London's Ben (thanks ben) is pioneering new frontiers in employee benefits and financial wellness.</li></ul><p>These in­vest­ments not only show­case Atom­ico's com­mit­ment to di­verse and in­no­v­a­tive star­tups but also high­light the firm's fo­cus on tech­nolo­gies that have the po­ten­tial to re­shape en­tire in­dus­tries.</p><h3>The Renaissance of European Tech: A Global Perspective</h3><p>Atom­ico's record-breaking fundraise comes at a piv­otal mo­ment for the Eu­ro­pean tech ecosys­tem. Re­cent data re­veals a seis­mic shift in the global in­no­va­tion land­scape, with Eu­rope now se­cur­ing nearly 30% of global early-stage fund­ing and out­pac­ing other re­gions in new com­pany cre­ation.</p><p>This trend, cou­pled with Atom­ico's sig­nif­i­cant new funds, paints a pic­ture of a Eu­ro­pean tech scene that's not just catch­ing up to tra­di­tional pow­er­houses like Sil­i­con Val­ley – it's chart­ing its own course and, in many ways, lead­ing the charge in key sec­tors.</p><h3>Beyond Capital: Building a Sustainable Tech Ecosystem</h3><p>Atom­ico's im­pact ex­tends far be­yond mere fi­nan­cial in­vest­ment. The firm has been in­stru­men­tal in build­ing a ro­bust sup­port sys­tem for Eu­ro­pean tech:</p><ul><li><strong>Talent Pipeline</strong>: Through initiatives like the Atomico Angels programme, the firm is cultivating the next generation of tech leaders and investors.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong>: Atomico's annual "State of European Tech" report has become the gold standard for understanding the ecosystem's health and trends.</li><li><strong>Policy Advocacy</strong>: The firm actively engages with policymakers to create a more favourable environment for tech innovation and entrepreneurship across Europe.</li></ul><p>These ef­forts con­tribute to a fly­wheel ef­fect, where suc­cess breeds more suc­cess, at­tract­ing global tal­ent and cap­i­tal to the Eu­ro­pean tech scene.</p><h3>A Bright Horizon: The Future of European Tech</h3><p>As we look to the fu­ture, Atom­ico's lat­est move po­si­tions the firm – and by ex­ten­sion, the en­tire Eu­ro­pean tech ecosys­tem – to cap­i­tal­ize on emerg­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and drive the next wave of tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs. From ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and quan­tum com­put­ing to cli­mate tech and space ex­plo­ration, Eu­ro­pean star­tups are at the fore­front of in­no­va­tion, backed by vi­sion­ary in­vestors like Atom­ico.</p><p>The mes­sage is clear: Eu­rope's tech scene is not just sur­viv­ing – it's thriv­ing, in­no­vat­ing, and ready to take cen­tre stage in the global tech nar­ra­tive. With Atom­ico's con­tin­ued sup­port and record-breaking funds, we can ex­pect to see a new gen­er­a­tion of Eu­ro­pean tech gi­ants emerg­ing, solv­ing global chal­lenges, and re­shap­ing in­dus­tries on a world­wide scale.</p><p>As we stand on the brink of this new era, one thing is cer­tain – the fu­ture of tech is not just in Sil­i­con Val­ley; it's be­ing writ­ten right here in Eu­rope, with Atom­ico hold­ing the pen. For en­tre­pre­neurs, in­vestors, and tech en­thu­si­asts alike, there has never been a more ex­cit­ing time to be part of the Eu­ro­pean tech story. The best, it seems, is yet to come.</p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/max-scotthayes">Max Scott-Hayes</a></li><li><a href="/tags/finance">finance</a></li><li><a href="/tags/vc">VC</a></li><li><a href="/tags/funds">funds</a></li></ul></article></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="/disqus.js"></script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript></body><body><footer><p><span>Copyright Group Works. </span><span>All rights reserved</span></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
