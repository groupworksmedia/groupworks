Tai­wan is a vastly di­verse place and con­tains mul­ti­tudes packed into 36,000 km2. Tai­wan was the first coun­try in Asia to le­galise same-sex mar­riage and is con­sis­tently ranked as the top Asian coun­try in the FI Hu­man Free­dom In­dex. I left Tai­wan when I was 8 years old hav­ing spent my early pri­mary school years here, but to get the chance to re­turn has been an op­por­tu­nity for re-discovery and learn­ing. Com­ing back 12 years later, I can see Tai­wan through a new lens to fully un­der­stand and ap­pre­ci­ate this of­ten mis­un­der­stood place.</p><p>One of the first ques­tions my friends had when I told them I was mov­ing to Tai­wan for a year was “What would hap­pen if Tai­wan was in­vaded while you are there?” - I’d leave. It is be­cause of that fact I don’t feel qual­i­fied to talk too much about life in Tai­wan in con­text with China be­cause I can pack up and re­turn to my safe home. I can­not un­der­stand what it is like to have your safety feel tem­po­rary, or maybe it doesn’t feel tem­po­rary to Tai­wanese peo­ple, I wouldn’t know be­cause I am not Tai­wanese. So, I want to hope­fully change peo­ple’s ini­tial thoughts on Tai­wan. I want to show you the Tai­wan I know.</p><p>A brief his­tory of Tai­wan: Tai­wan used to be con­nected to what is now main­land China by a nat­ural land bridge, how­ever as that dis­ap­peared the peo­ple on the is­land of For­mosa (Tai­wan) were cut off from con­ti­nen­tal Asia. They be­gan ex­plor­ing other Pa­cific is­lands and, as a re­sult, most Poly­ne­sian abo­rig­i­nal peo­ples are de­scen­dants of the Aus­trone­sian Tai­wanese pop­u­la­tion. In the early 1600s, The Dutch East In­dia Com­pany set up in south­ern For­mosa and Span­ish colo­nial mis­sions set­tled in the north. The Chi­nese Ming dy­nasty fought the Eu­ro­peans out of For­mosa be­fore be­ing re­placed by Qing dy­nasty set­tlers who claimed the is­land as a Qing province in the late 1800s. Fol­low­ing the First Sino-Japanese War, Tai­wan was then colonised by the Japan­ese Em­pire. The Re­pub­lic of China was es­tab­lished on the main­land and took over the Qing dy­nasty. By 1948, China was en­gaged in a civil war be­tween the RoC (Chi­ang Kai-Shek’s Party) and the CCP (Mao Ze­Dong’s Party) be­fore the RoC re­treated to Tai­wan. Tai­wan was run as a harsh dic­ta­tor­ship un­der Chi­ang Kai-Shek un­til mar­tial law ended in 1987.</p><p>In Au­gust I moved from Lon­don to Taipei, mak­ing the jump to live in a for­eign coun­try on my own for the first time. It was daunt­ing but never scary. I was slightly fa­mil­iar with Taipei and knew how friendly Tai­wanese peo­ple are, es­pe­cially to for­eign­ers who might look a bit lost. That cer­tainly hasn’t changed. I think when I leave, the story I will tell to con­vey how warm and wel­com­ing Tai­wanese peo­ple are will be: My friend re­cently broke his foot and is on crutches, his flimsy rain­coat does very lit­tle to pro­tect him from the trop­i­cal rain, yet he found that so many peo­ple were will­ing to share their um­brella over him as he cau­tiously crutches in the rain - he doesn’t know these strangers and they don’t make a big fuss about it, they just see some­one in need of help and jump to shel­ter him from the rain, if only for a lit­tle while. Ob­vi­ously, his ex­pe­ri­ence as a blonde-haired blue-eyed for­eigner does grant him some ben­e­fits, but we both lament that this would never hap­pen in Lon­don. An­other friend was be­ing chased down the street by a man shout­ing af­ter him - the man fol­lowed him the length of the street just to re­turn the money my friend had dropped at the ATM. On the MRT (sub­way/tube sys­tem in Taipei) no one would be caught dead sit­ting on the pri­or­ity seats, even if the train is crammed. I am al­ways think­ing ‘oh, this would never hap­pen in Lon­don’ - con­stantly heart­ened by the care peo­ple have for oth­ers.</p><img src="https://groupworks.media/images/Taiwan/TraditionalRoofTiles.jpg"/><p>Taipei is, by far, the most en­vi­ron­men­tally con­scious city I have ever lived in. Tai­wan’s re­cy­cling rate is an as­ton­ish­ing 55% (the high­est in the world). Pre­vi­ously Tai­wan just col­lected and burned its rub­bish, how­ever, the Home­mak­ers United group went to the EPA and brought about a mas­sive change in the Tai­wanese rub­bish sys­tem. In Taipei, 5 nights a week the rub­bish truck comes to your lo­cal des­ig­nated spot blast­ing Für Elise so that every­one in the area knows to come and take out their rub­bish. Fol­low­ing the yel­low truck is a smaller white truck for re­cy­cling with sep­a­rate days for plas­tic, pa­per, glass, and com­postable waste col­lec­tion. Tai­wan is well on its way to meet­ing its promise to ban all single-use plas­tics by 2030 - when the ban on single-use plas­tic cups was an­nounced in July this year, by the fi­nal­i­sa­tion of the pol­icy single-use plas­tic cups had al­ready been re­duced by 17%. Taipei it­self is sur­rounded on all sides by moun­tains, en­cour­ag­ing you to ex­plore and em­brace your re­la­tion­ship with na­ture from just a few MRT stops away. Taipei is an in­cred­i­bly walk­a­ble city, and just a quick wan­der around will show how con­nected peo­ple are to na­ture as every bal­cony re­sem­bles its own mini-forest.</p><p>I think the most glar­ingly ob­vi­ous dif­fer­ence be­tween Taipei and Lon­don is the care peo­ple put into pub­lic in­fra­struc­ture. The MRT is al­most 100% step-free and ac­ces­si­ble across the whole sys­tem and mu­sic plays and lights flash to alert you of the train ar­riv­ing train for bet­ter ac­ces­si­bil­ity and in­clu­siv­ity. Every­one re­spects the no food and drink signs on the MRT and its clean­li­ness has made me re­alise how truly grotty TFL can be. The streets are so clean, which seems un­likely as you’d be hard-pressed to find a bin any­where. In­stead, peo­ple take their rub­bish home with them for it to be prop­erly dis­posed of and pre­vent over­flow­ing pub­lic bins. Out­side most shops and restau­rants, there are lit­tle stands to leave your wet um­brella on. Peo­ple can do this be­cause they don’t want to dirty the shop and they trust that no one is go­ing to steal it. In cafes, peo­ple leave all their be­long­ings at their ta­ble while they go to the toi­let or for a smoke be­cause it is safe. But most im­por­tantly, I have never felt so safe walk­ing home alone at night. There is an em­pha­sis on con­sid­er­a­tion for strangers and cre­at­ing the space for oth­ers that you want for your­self.</p><p>I want to share with the rest of the world the Taipei that I know. Whilst most peo­ple might im­me­di­ately think of war or ten­sor chips when the topic of Tai­wan comes up, I think of the care every­one has for the in­fra­struc­ture, the en­vi­ron­ment, and the peo­ple around them. I hope that when I re­turn to Lon­don, I can bring back a deeper care for the com­mu­nity around me and a re­newed un­der­stand­ing of the need for en­vi­ron­men­tal pro­tec­tion, in both the nat­ural world and for our shared pub­lic ser­vices.</p><h5>Sources:</h5><p><style>.wrapper a[href*="www.fraserinstitute.org"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.fraserinstitute.org);}</style><a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/human-freedom-index-2022.pdf">Fraser In­sti­tute</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="rapidtransition.org"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=rapidtransition.org);}</style><a href="https://rapidtransition.org/stories/taiwans-transition-from-garbage-island-to-recycling-leader/">Rapid Tran­si­tion</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.sustainableplastics.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.sustainableplastics.com);}</style><a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/taiwan-finalise-single-use-plastic-cups-ban-september">Sus­tain­able Plas­tics</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.taiwan.gov.tw"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.taiwan.gov.tw);}</style><a href="https://www.taiwan.gov.tw/content_3.php">Tai­wan Gov­erne­ment</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.theguardian.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theguardian.com);}</style><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/after-hong-kong-china-taiwan-invasion-armed-forces">The Guardian</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.aljazeera.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.aljazeera.com);}</style><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/5/25/fearing-war-with-china-civilians-in-taiwan-prepare-for-disaster-2">Al­jazeera</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-24-ResurgenceForCrypt</guid><title>A Resurgence for Crypto? VC Investment Signals New Dawn for Digital Assets</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-24-ResurgenceForCrypt</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Sep 2024 15:30:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://groupworks.media/images/Taiwan/pexels.jpeg" alt="Bitcoins on hundred dollar bills"/><p>The land­scape of cryp­tocur­rency and blockchain tech­nol­ogy is not with­out its ups and downs, yet ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) in­vest­ments may be­gin to serve as a barom­e­ter for the in­dus­try's health and po­ten­tial. Re­cent data and mar­ket de­vel­op­ments sug­gest that we might be wit­ness­ing the be­gin­ning of a new chap­ter in the crypto saga. So it’s im­por­tant we try and un­der­stand what's hap­pen­ing and what it could mean for the fu­ture of dig­i­tal as­sets.</p><h3>The Numbers Don't Lie: VC Funding on the Rise</h3><p>Ac­cord­ing to re­cent data from Galaxy Dig­i­tal, ven­ture cap­i­tal fund­ing in crypto star­tups has seen a sig­nif­i­cant uptick, reach­ing $3.2 bil­lion in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2024, the high­est amount for a three-month pe­riod since 2022. This marks a sub­stan­tial in­crease from $2.5 bil­lion in the first quar­ter of the same year. What's par­tic­u­larly note­wor­thy is that this rise in crypto VC fund­ing comes at a time when global ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ments have hit a near five-year low.</p><p>This resur­gence in fund­ing is even more im­pres­sive when we con­sider the broader con­text. Crypto startup fund­ing has been on a down­ward trend since its peak of over $10 bil­lion in the first quar­ter of 2022. The re­cent up­turn sug­gests a re­newed con­fi­dence in the sec­tor, dri­ven by sev­eral key fac­tors.</p><h3>Catalysts for the Crypto Comeback</h3><ol><li><em>Market Performance</em>: Despite recent fluctuations, Bitcoin is still up 34% this year as of September 2024, outperforming the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index. This performance is particularly noteworthy given the broader economic uncertainties and has reignited interest from both retail and institutional investors.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><em>Regulatory Milestones</em>: The landmark U.S. regulatory approval of spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 has been a game-changer, boosting the legitimacy of crypto as an asset class. This move allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a familiar investment vehicle, potentially bringing billions of dollars of new investment into the crypto ecosystem.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><em>Macroeconomic Factors</em>: Expectations of lower interest rates have created a more favourable environment for risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Seen most recently as the Fed made its first cut to interest rates even more so than what was expected.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><em>Infrastructure Focus</em>: A significant portion of VC funding is being directed towards startups building infrastructure for crypto and blockchain technology, indicating a maturation of the industry.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><em>AI Integration</em>: The intersection of crypto and AI has become a notably active area, attracting significant investor interest. This convergence is seen as a potential catalyst for new use cases and enhanced functionality in blockchain systems, from improved smart contract execution to more sophisticated decentralised finance (DeFi) applications.</li></ol><h3>Where the Money is Going</h3><p>The lat­est fund­ing data re­veals some in­ter­est­ing trends in terms of where VCs are plac­ing their bets:</p><ol><li><em>Early-Stage Investments</em>: There's a notable emphasis on early-stage deals, with median pre-money valuations surging from $19 million to $37 million, according to Galaxy.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><em>Web3, Metaverse, and Gaming</em>: These sectors raised the most money from investors in the second quarter of 2024, followed closely by infrastructure companies.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><em>AI and Blockchain Convergence</em>: Companies like Sentient Labs, which raised $85 million this year, exemplify the growing interest in combining blockchain and AI technologies.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><em>Modular Blockchain Solutions</em>: Celestia Foundation secured $100 million in a funding round led by Bain Capital Crypto, highlighting the interest in scalable blockchain architectures.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><em>Stablecoin Innovations</em>: PayPal's PYUSD stablecoin saw its market cap soar 84% in a month, reaching $500 million at the time and now is at over a billion, demonstrating the potential for traditional finance players in the crypto space.</li></ol><h3>New Funds and Emerging Players</h3><p>The crypto in­vest­ment land­scape is also see­ing the emer­gence of new funds and play­ers:</p><ol><li><em>Paradigm</em>: The California-based VC firm raised $850 million for its third crypto fund. This substantial raise by a respected player in the space signals continued institutional interest in crypto investments, despite the market volatility of recent years.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><em>Auros</em>: The crypto trading firm created a new venture arm with plans to invest $50 million into digital asset startups. This move by a trading firm into venture capital highlights the blurring lines between different segments of the crypto industry and the growing sophistication of the ecosystem.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><em>Halo Capital</em>: A new $25 million venture fund launched by Daniel Howard (son of hedge-fund billionaire Alan Howard) and Bhavin Vaid, focusing on a generalist approach across the entire crypto ecosystem. The entry of second-generation investors with ties to traditional finance underscores the growing legitimacy of crypto as an asset class and could help bridge the gap between traditional and crypto finance.</li></ol><h3>Is Crypto Really Back?</h3><p>While the re­cent surge in VC fund­ing and mar­ket per­for­mance are cer­tainly pos­i­tive in­di­ca­tors, it's im­por­tant to ap­proach the ques­tion of "Is crypto back?" with nu­ance:</p><ol><li><em>Maturation, Not Just Speculation</em>: The focus on infrastructure, AI integration, and real-world applications suggests that the industry is moving beyond pure speculation towards creating tangible value. This shift from speculative fervour to practical application development is a sign of a maturing industry.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><em>Institutional Adoption</em>: The entry of major financial institutions into the crypto space through ETFs and stablecoins indicates growing mainstream acceptance. This institutional involvement brings not only capital but also expertise and credibility to the crypto ecosystem.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><em>Innovation Continues</em>: The rise of modular blockchain solutions like Celestia and the integration of AI with blockchain demonstrate that innovation in the space is far from over. These developments could address some of the fundamental challenges facing blockchain technology, potentially unlocking new use cases and driving wider adoption.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><em>Cautious Optimism</em>: While valuations and funding are increasing, they're not yet at the frenzied levels seen in previous bull markets, suggesting a more measured approach from investors. This cautious optimism could lead to more sustainable growth and development in the long term. But being said its still to new to say that it couldn’t experience similar turmoil crypto has faced in the past.</li></ol><h3>Looking Ahead: Potential Trends and Challenges</h3><p>As we look to the fu­ture of crypto and VC in­vest­ments in the space, sev­eral trends and chal­lenges emerge:</p><ol><li><em>Regulatory Scrutiny</em>: As the industry grows, it's likely to face increased regulatory attention. There are reports of the SEC investigating VCs for potentially acting as unregistered securities dealers. This regulatory landscape will play a crucial role in shaping the future of crypto investments and could lead to a more structured and compliant ecosystem.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><em>Consolidation</em>: We may see an increase in mergers and acquisitions, as exemplified by Standard Chartered-backed Zodia Markets' talks to acquire Elwood Capital. This consolidation could lead to the emergence of stronger, more resilient players in the crypto space, potentially accelerating the industry's maturation.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><em>Global Competition</em>: Different countries' approaches to crypto regulation and adoption may shift the global landscape of crypto innovation and investment. This could lead to the emergence of new crypto hubs and potentially a more fragmented global crypto ecosystem.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><em>Balancing Hype and Substance</em>: While sectors like AI and crypto integration are attracting significant funding, it will be crucial for companies to deliver on their promises and create real value. The industry's ability to move beyond hype and demonstrate practical applications will be key to sustaining long-term growth and adoption.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The re­cent surge in VC fund­ing for crypto star­tups, cou­pled with pos­i­tive mar­ket de­vel­op­ments, sug­gests that we're en­ter­ing a new phase in the evo­lu­tion of dig­i­tal as­sets. While it's pre­ma­ture to de­clare that "crypto is back" in the sense of re­turn­ing to the fren­zied heights of pre­vi­ous bull mar­kets, the cur­rent trends point to a more ma­ture, infrastructure-focused, and po­ten­tially more sus­tain­able growth phase for the in­dus­try.</p><p>As ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists con­tinue to bet on the fu­ture of crypto and blockchain tech­nol­ogy, we're likely to see more in­no­v­a­tive ap­pli­ca­tions, im­proved in­fra­struc­ture, and greater in­te­gra­tion with tra­di­tional fi­nance and emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies like AI. For in­vestors, en­tre­pre­neurs, and en­thu­si­asts in the space, these de­vel­op­ments sig­nal ex­cit­ing times ahead, al­beit with the usual caveat that the crypto mar­ket re­mains highly dy­namic and un­pre­dictable.</p><p>The key for the in­dus­try now will be to cap­i­talise on this re­newed in­ter­est and fund­ing to build prod­ucts and ser­vices that de­liver real value, en­hance trust, and drive wider adop­tion of blockchain tech­nol­ogy. If suc­cess­ful, we may in­deed look back on this pe­riod as the be­gin­ning of crypto's true come­back – not as a spec­u­la­tive frenzy, but as the foun­da­tion of a trans­for­ma­tive tech­nol­ogy that re­shapes how we think about fi­nance, own­er­ship, and dig­i­tal in­ter­ac­tion. More com­pli­ance and more struc­ture must come for this to con­tinue and work at a sus­tain­able pace.</p><h5>Sources:</h5><p><style>.wrapper a[href*="www.bloomberg.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.bloomberg.com);}</style><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/alan-howard-s-son-starts-a-crypto-venture-fund-with-colleague?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.reuters.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.reuters.com);}</style><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/venture-capital-funding-crypto-rises-24-bln-pitchbook-says-2024-05-20/">Reuters</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.theblock.co"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theblock.co);}</style><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/317642/the-funding-crypto-vcs-fundraising-spree">The Block</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.ft.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.ft.com);}</style><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f056417-fbb1-4c72-aca0-640930731b1f">FT</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/politics/2024-09-22-RussianInfluence</guid><title>Russian Influence in the Sahel - Is the West Losing Out?</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/politics/2024-09-22-RussianInfluence</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sa­hel re­gion has emerged as a crit­i­cal arena of in­creas­ing po­lar­i­sa­tion be­tween pro-Western "mod­er­ate" na­tions and those striv­ing for au­ton­omy from neo-colonial in­flu­ences, opt­ing in­stead to en­gage with non-African pow­ers such as Rus­sia.<br /><br />On July 6, Mali, Burk­ina Faso, and Niger so­lid­i­fied their al­liance by es­tab­lish­ing the <em>Con­fed­er­a­tion of Sa­hel States</em> (AES), a coali­tion of military-led gov­ern­ments that re­ject West­ern pres­sures, par­tic­u­larly from the Eco­nomic Com­mu­nity of West African States (ECOWAS).</p><img src="https://groupworks.media/images/Taiwan/RussiaSahel.png"/><p>The tim­ing of the AES's for­ma­tion, oc­cur­ring just one day prior to the ECOWAS sum­mit in Nige­ria, was de­lib­er­ate and un­der­scored the widen­ing rift in West Africa. For the United States and the Eu­ro­pean Union, this de­vel­op­ment in­di­cates a com­plex geopo­lit­i­cal tran­si­tion, prompt­ing con­cerns re­gard­ing re­gional sta­bil­ity and in­flu­ence within the Sa­hel. These coun­tries, all cur­rently un­der mil­i­tary gov­er­nance fol­low­ing coups that re­moved pro-Western ad­min­is­tra­tions, are in­tent on pur­su­ing a new tra­jec­tory.<br /><br />The es­tab­lish­ment of the AES re­flects the dis­con­tent ex­pressed by Burk­ina Faso, Mali, and Niger re­gard­ing their treat­ment by the African Union and ECOWAS. These na­tions con­tend that both or­gan­i­sa­tions have in­ad­e­quately sup­ported their ef­forts to com­bat ji­hadist in­sur­gen­cies.<br /><br />In March, a del­e­ga­tion from the United States, headed by As­sis­tant Sec­re­tary of State Molly Phee, along with Ce­leste Wal­lan­der and Gen­eral Michael Lan­g­ley from U.S. Africa Com­mand, faced a re­buff from the leader of the mil­i­tary junta in Niger. The U.S. of­fi­cials aimed to dis­cuss the fu­ture of the two mil­i­tary bases they main­tained in the na­tion.<br /><br />How­ever, just two days af­ter their de­par­ture, U.S. of­fi­cials dis­cov­ered through a Face­book an­nounce­ment that Niger had ter­mi­nated the bi­lat­eral agree­ment es­tab­lished in 2012.<br /><br />A spokesper­son for the junta re­marked that the U.S. del­e­ga­tion ex­hib­ited a "con­de­scend­ing at­ti­tude" and sought to un­der­mine the "sov­er­eign peo­ple of Niger's right to se­lect their part­ners and the types of part­ner­ships that could gen­uinely as­sist in com­bat­ing ter­ror­ism."<br /><br />Amer­i­can of­fi­cials ac­knowl­edged that they had voiced con­cerns re­gard­ing Niger's grow­ing ties with Rus­sia and Iran. A week later, Moscow re­vealed that it had en­gaged in a phone con­ver­sa­tion with Gen­eral Ab­doura­hamane Tiani, the head of Niger's junta, to dis­cuss "en­hanc­ing se­cu­rity co­op­er­a­tion."<br /><br />This de­vel­op­ment sig­ni­fies a broader with­drawal of West­ern forces from West Africa, a trend catal­ysed by mil­i­tary coups that have strained re­la­tions be­tween the af­fected na­tions and West­ern pow­ers. It also re­flects sig­nif­i­cant shifts within the re­gion, where anti-Western sen­ti­ments and al­liances with non-Western na­tions, par­tic­u­larly Rus­sia, are be­com­ing in­creas­ingly promi­nent. As the Sa­hel re­gion moves to­wards closer re­la­tions with Rus­sia, the United States is crit­i­cally re­assess­ing its in­volve­ment in the Sa­hel, which has his­tor­i­cally been a vi­tal area for coun­ter­ing al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS)-af­fil­i­ated groups.</p><h5>Sources</h5><ol><li><style>.wrapper a[href*="www.msn.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.msn.com);}</style><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/opinion-dwindling-western-influence-amid-uncertainty-in-the-sahel-region/ar-AA1qCBz8">MSN News</a></li><li><style>.wrapper a[href*="www.ft.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.ft.com);}</style><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9fd4d44-fb63-40c1-8280-a1a685c63396">Financial Times</a></li><li><style>.wrapper a[href*="carnegieendowment.org"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=carnegieendowment.org);}</style><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/02/russias-growing-footprint-in-africas-sahel-region?lang=en">Carnegie Endowment</a></li></ol>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-09-AtomicoFundraise</guid><title>Atomico's $1.24B Fundraise: A New Chapter for Venture Capital in Europe</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-09-AtomicoFundraise</link><pubDate>Mon, 9 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a land­mark mo­ment for the Eu­ro­pean tech ecosys­tem, London-based ven­ture cap­i­tal ti­tan Atom­ico has shat­tered records with its lat­est fundraise, se­cur­ing an un­prece­dented $1.24 bil­lion across two new funds. This mon­u­men­tal achieve­ment not only un­der­scores the re­silience of the Eu­ro­pean VC land­scape but also sig­nals a seis­mic shift in the global tech in­dus­try, po­si­tion­ing Eu­rope as a for­mi­da­ble con­tender on the world stage.</p><h3>A Strategic Dual-Fund Approach: Nurturing Innovation from Seed to IPO</h3><p>Atom­ico's vi­sion­ary fundrais­ing strat­egy splits its new cap­i­tal be­tween two com­ple­men­tary funds:</p><ol><li><strong>Atomico Growth VI</strong>: A whopping $754 million dedicated to propelling companies from Series B to pre-IPO stages, addressing a critical funding gap in the European ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Atomico Venture VI</strong>: A robust $485 million early-stage fund, primarily targeting Series A investments while maintaining flexibility for exceptional seed opportunities.</li></ol><p>This dual-fund ap­proach rep­re­sents a holis­tic vi­sion for sup­port­ing Eu­ro­pean tech, en­sur­ing a con­tin­u­ous pipeline of sup­port from nascent star­tups to industry-defining uni­corns. By cov­er­ing the en­tire spec­trum of a com­pany's growth jour­ney, Atom­ico is po­si­tion­ing it­self as the ul­ti­mate part­ner for am­bi­tious Eu­ro­pean founders.</p><h3>Empowering Europe's Tech Visionaries: A Founder-First Philosophy</h3><p>Niklas Zennström, the leg­endary en­tre­pre­neur be­hind Skype and founder of Atom­ico, ar­tic­u­lates the firm's mis­sion with char­ac­ter­is­tic in­sight: "Eu­ro­pean tech­nol­ogy is com­ing of age. Meet­ing this op­por­tu­nity re­quires am­bi­tion, hus­tle, and com­mit­ment from founders, who need in­vestors with the ex­pe­ri­ence and per­spec­tive to see be­yond mar­ket cy­cles."</p><p>Zennström's words res­onate deeply within the tech com­mu­nity, high­light­ing Atom­ico's unique po­si­tion as a VC firm founded by en­tre­pre­neurs, for en­tre­pre­neurs. This founder-centric ap­proach, com­bined with Atom­ico's vast re­sources and net­work, cre­ates an un­par­al­leled sup­port sys­tem for Eu­rope's most promis­ing tech in­no­va­tors.</p><h3>A Legacy of Success: From Startup to Unicorn</h3><p>Atom­ico's faith in Eu­ro­pean tech is far from blind op­ti­mism – it's grounded in a track record of phe­nom­e­nal suc­cess. With a port­fo­lio span­ning over 155 am­bi­tious teams across 15 Eu­ro­pean coun­tries, Atom­ico has con­sis­tently demon­strated its abil­ity to iden­tify and nur­ture world-changing ideas. The num­bers speak for them­selves: an as­tound­ing 1 in 6 of Atom­ico's port­fo­lio com­pa­nies has achieved uni­corn sta­tus, val­ued at over $1 bil­lion.</p><p>This im­pres­sive hit rate in­cludes early in­vest­ments in fin­tech rev­o­lu­tion­ar­ies like Klarna and Stripe, as well as ground­break­ing com­pa­nies across var­i­ous sec­tors. Atom­ico's golden touch has not only gen­er­ated ex­cep­tional re­turns but has also played a cru­cial role in shap­ing the Eu­ro­pean tech land­scape.</p><h3>Investing in Tomorrow: A Glimpse into the Future of Tech</h3><p>The new funds have al­ready made sig­nif­i­cant in­roads, with 21 in­vest­ments across cutting-edge sec­tors that promise to de­fine the fu­ture of tech­nol­ogy:</p><ul><li><strong>AI and Machine Learning</strong>: Zurich-based Lakera is pushing the boundaries of AI security, while Oslo's Strise is revolutionising enterprise intelligence with its AI-powered platform.</li><li><strong>Health Tech</strong>: Stockholm's Neko Health is reimagining preventive healthcare with full-body scans, and Copenhagen's Corti is leveraging AI to save lives in emergency medical situations.</li><li><strong>Enterprise Software</strong>: Berlin's Deeploi is streamlining IT operations for SMEs, and London's Dexory is transforming warehouse management with robotics and AI.</li><li><strong>Fintech</strong>: London's Ben (thanks ben) is pioneering new frontiers in employee benefits and financial wellness.</li></ul><p>These in­vest­ments not only show­case Atom­ico's com­mit­ment to di­verse and in­no­v­a­tive star­tups but also high­light the firm's fo­cus on tech­nolo­gies that have the po­ten­tial to re­shape en­tire in­dus­tries.</p><h3>The Renaissance of European Tech: A Global Perspective</h3><p>Atom­ico's record-breaking fundraise comes at a piv­otal mo­ment for the Eu­ro­pean tech ecosys­tem. Re­cent data re­veals a seis­mic shift in the global in­no­va­tion land­scape, with Eu­rope now se­cur­ing nearly 30% of global early-stage fund­ing and out­pac­ing other re­gions in new com­pany cre­ation.</p><p>This trend, cou­pled with Atom­ico's sig­nif­i­cant new funds, paints a pic­ture of a Eu­ro­pean tech scene that's not just catch­ing up to tra­di­tional pow­er­houses like Sil­i­con Val­ley – it's chart­ing its own course and, in many ways, lead­ing the charge in key sec­tors.</p><h3>Beyond Capital: Building a Sustainable Tech Ecosystem</h3><p>Atom­ico's im­pact ex­tends far be­yond mere fi­nan­cial in­vest­ment. The firm has been in­stru­men­tal in build­ing a ro­bust sup­port sys­tem for Eu­ro­pean tech:</p><ul><li><strong>Talent Pipeline</strong>: Through initiatives like the Atomico Angels programme, the firm is cultivating the next generation of tech leaders and investors.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Sharing</strong>: Atomico's annual "State of European Tech" report has become the gold standard for understanding the ecosystem's health and trends.</li><li><strong>Policy Advocacy</strong>: The firm actively engages with policymakers to create a more favourable environment for tech innovation and entrepreneurship across Europe.</li></ul><p>These ef­forts con­tribute to a fly­wheel ef­fect, where suc­cess breeds more suc­cess, at­tract­ing global tal­ent and cap­i­tal to the Eu­ro­pean tech scene.</p><h3>A Bright Horizon: The Future of European Tech</h3><p>As we look to the fu­ture, Atom­ico's lat­est move po­si­tions the firm – and by ex­ten­sion, the en­tire Eu­ro­pean tech ecosys­tem – to cap­i­tal­ize on emerg­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties and drive the next wave of tech­no­log­i­cal break­throughs. From ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence and quan­tum com­put­ing to cli­mate tech and space ex­plo­ration, Eu­ro­pean star­tups are at the fore­front of in­no­va­tion, backed by vi­sion­ary in­vestors like Atom­ico.</p><p>The mes­sage is clear: Eu­rope's tech scene is not just sur­viv­ing – it's thriv­ing, in­no­vat­ing, and ready to take cen­tre stage in the global tech nar­ra­tive. With Atom­ico's con­tin­ued sup­port and record-breaking funds, we can ex­pect to see a new gen­er­a­tion of Eu­ro­pean tech gi­ants emerg­ing, solv­ing global chal­lenges, and re­shap­ing in­dus­tries on a world­wide scale.</p><p>As we stand on the brink of this new era, one thing is cer­tain – the fu­ture of tech is not just in Sil­i­con Val­ley; it's be­ing writ­ten right here in Eu­rope, with Atom­ico hold­ing the pen. For en­tre­pre­neurs, in­vestors, and tech en­thu­si­asts alike, there has never been a more ex­cit­ing time to be part of the Eu­ro­pean tech story. The best, it seems, is yet to come.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-09-Myricx%20BioSeriesA</guid><title>Myricx Bio's £90M Series A: A Venture Capital Triumph for European Biotech</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-09-09-Myricx%20BioSeriesA</link><pubDate>Mon, 9 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In an un­prece­dented mile­stone for Eu­ro­pean biotech, Myricx Bio, a London-based can­cer ther­apy startup, has closed a re­mark­able £90 mil­lion ($114 mil­lion) Se­ries A fund­ing round. This record-breaking in­vest­ment rep­re­sents one of the largest early-stage in­vest­ments in a Eu­ro­pean aca­d­e­mic biotech spin­out, cap­tur­ing the at­ten­tion of global in­vestors and sig­nalling a piv­otal mo­ment for ven­ture cap­i­tal (VC) in Eu­rope.</p><h3>A Clear Vote of Confidence from Top-Tier Investors</h3><p>The Se­ries A round was spear­headed by two of the most re­spected names in life sci­ences VC—Novo Hold­ings and Abing­worth—both known for back­ing high-impact biotech star­tups. They were joined by a pres­ti­gious group of co-investors, which in­cludes:</p><ul><li><strong>British Patient Capital</strong>, demonstrating public sector support for innovative healthcare ventures.</li><li><strong>Cancer Research Horizons</strong>, reflecting the nonprofit's trust in Myricx’s potential to contribute to cancer research.</li><li><strong>Eli Lilly</strong>, highlighting Big Pharma’s commitment to groundbreaking biotech developments.</li><li><strong>Brandon Capital</strong> and <strong>Sofinnova Partners</strong>, both returning investors, a testament to the company’s progress since earlier funding rounds.</li></ul><p>The wide ar­ray of stake­hold­ers in­volved, from tra­di­tional VCs to global phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal play­ers, un­der­scores the broad ap­peal and po­ten­tial of Myricx’s sci­ence. This align­ment of in­ter­ests be­tween di­verse in­vestors is rare and is a re­sound­ing en­dorse­ment of the dis­rup­tive po­ten­tial Myricx Bio of­fers the on­col­ogy space.</p><h3>Changing the Face of European Biotech Funding</h3><p>Tra­di­tion­ally, Eu­ro­pean biotechs have faced sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges when rais­ing large-scale fi­nanc­ing com­pared to their Amer­i­can coun­ter­parts. How­ever, Myricx’s Se­ries A chal­lenges that no­tion head-on.</p><p>This record-breaking round show­cases the im­mense po­ten­tial of Eu­ro­pean biotech. It's a clear sig­nal that world-class in­no­va­tion from UK in­sti­tu­tions can at­tract sub­stan­tial ven­ture cap­i­tal, com­pet­ing on a global stage.</p><p>For VCs, this deal is not just about one com­pany—it’s about trans­form­ing per­cep­tions of Eu­rope’s biotech sec­tor. Ven­ture cap­i­tal in Eu­rope has of­ten been viewed as more risk-averse than in the US. But the suc­cess of Myricx Bio demon­strates that with the right tech­nol­ogy, Eu­ro­pean star­tups can at­tract size­able fund­ing, sig­nalling a shift in how Eu­ro­pean biotechs are val­ued and sup­ported.</p><h3>Pioneering Science Meets Venture Capital Enthusiasm</h3><p>One of the main rea­sons Myricx Bio at­tracted such high-profile in­vestors is the in­no­v­a­tive ap­proach they’re bring­ing to can­cer ther­apy. The com­pany's ground­break­ing work on antibody-drug con­ju­gates (ADCs) is at the fore­front of new treat­ment par­a­digms. Un­like many on­col­ogy plat­forms, Myricx’s tech­nol­ogy tar­gets <strong>N-myristoyltransferase (NMT)</strong>, an en­zyme es­sen­tial for the growth of cer­tain can­cer cells.</p><p>This unique mech­a­nism of ac­tion pro­vides a fresh av­enue for can­cer treat­ment, which has cap­ti­vated ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists look­ing for high-potential bets in the crowded on­col­ogy space.</p><p>This in­vest­ment, has po­ten­tial to re­shape the land­scape of can­cer ther­apy. The strong sup­port from ven­ture cap­i­tal part­ners en­ables them to push the bound­aries of what's pos­si­ble in ADC de­vel­op­ment.</p><p>From a ven­ture cap­i­tal per­spec­tive, the po­ten­tial re­turns on in­vest­ment are vast. ADCs have shown enor­mous promise as next-generation can­cer treat­ments, and a plat­form that could fun­da­men­tally im­prove their pre­ci­sion and ef­fec­tive­ness is a golden op­por­tu­nity. The in­no­v­a­tive edge and po­ten­tial scal­a­bil­ity of Myricx’s work makes it an at­trac­tive prospect for in­vestors keen on trans­for­ma­tive sci­ence.</p><h3>Scaling Up: From Idea to Impact</h3><p>For ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists, Myricx’s Se­ries A in­vest­ment goes be­yond back­ing novel sci­ence—it’s about fu­elling ex­po­nen­tial growth. The in­flux of cap­i­tal will al­low the com­pany to sig­nif­i­cantly scale its op­er­a­tions, turn­ing cutting-edge aca­d­e­mic re­search into market-ready ther­a­pies. Here’s how the fund­ing will be utilised:</p><ol><li><strong>Team Expansion:</strong> From a current headcount of just four, Myricx plans to increase its team to around 15 full-time employees. This will add critical expertise across R&amp;D, regulatory affairs, and business development, all key areas for startups transitioning from discovery to development stages.<ul></ul></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Establishing R&amp;D Facilities:</strong> The company will set up in-house R&amp;D laboratories in London, providing the infrastructure needed to accelerate research into clinical trials.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Advancing Clinical Programs:</strong> Two lead programs are expected to enter clinical trials, with the first Phase 1 trial targeted for early 2026. Investors are particularly eager about the projected timeline for proof-of-concept data in 2027 and 2028, milestones that could dramatically increase Myricx’s valuation and set the stage for future fundraising rounds or strategic partnerships.</li></ol><h3>Catalysing European Biotech and Venture Capital Ecosystems</h3><p>Myricx’s suc­cess has im­pli­ca­tions far be­yond the com­pany it­self. It rep­re­sents a cat­a­lyst for the broader Eu­ro­pean biotech ecosys­tem, demon­strat­ing that sub­stan­tial early-stage ven­ture cap­i­tal can be suc­cess­fully raised for ground­break­ing life sci­ences in­no­va­tion. This sends a pow­er­ful sig­nal to both star­tups and in­vestors across Eu­rope that the re­gion is ready to sup­port world-class biotech ven­tures.</p><p>For ven­ture cap­i­tal­ists, this in­vest­ment sets a new bench­mark for what’s pos­si­ble in Eu­ro­pean biotech. It proves that Eu­rope is ca­pa­ble of pro­duc­ing com­pa­nies with the sci­ence, lead­er­ship, and po­ten­tial to de­liver out­sized re­turns—fac­tors that tra­di­tion­ally at­tracted more in­vest­ment dol­lars to the US.</p><p>The back­ing of global pharma gi­ant <strong>Eli Lilly</strong> also high­lights the grow­ing trend of phar­ma­ceu­ti­cal com­pa­nies work­ing more closely with early-stage biotechs, cre­at­ing new op­por­tu­ni­ties for VC-backed firms to ac­cess the re­sources and ex­per­tise needed for com­mer­cial suc­cess.</p><h3>A Positive Outlook for the Future</h3><p>As Myricx Bio moves for­ward, it car­ries the hopes not only of its in­vestors but also of the wider biotech and VC com­mu­ni­ties. This fund­ing round is about more than just cap­i­tal—it’s about cred­i­bil­ity, vis­i­bil­ity, and mo­men­tum. The com­pany’s suc­cess could pave the way for fur­ther VC in­vest­ments in Eu­ro­pean biotech, cre­at­ing a vir­tu­ous cy­cle of fund­ing, in­no­va­tion, and com­mer­cial­i­sa­tion.</p><p>With this his­toric Se­ries A, Myricx Bio stands as a sym­bol of the po­ten­tial for Eu­ro­pean star­tups to make a global im­pact, at­tract­ing high-caliber in­vestors and blaz­ing a trail for oth­ers to fol­low. The in­ter­sec­tion of pi­o­neer­ing sci­ence and ven­ture cap­i­tal am­bi­tion makes this a mo­ment to cel­e­brate, not just for Myricx, but for Eu­ro­pean biotech as a whole.</p><p>As we look to the fu­ture, it’s clear: Eu­ro­pean biotech is ready to play on the global stage, and ven­ture cap­i­tal is there to fuel that rise.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/technology/2024-09-08-WatchWeb</guid><title>Apple Watch web browser</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/technology/2024-09-08-WatchWeb</link><pubDate>Sun, 8 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the first time Ap­ple Watch has a func­tional browser in the WatchOS 11 pub­lic beta ahead of the new Ap­ple Watch launch on the 9th Sep­tem­ber.

The three things that the phone needs to do well:</p><ol><li>Calling and Messaging</li><li>Music Playback</li><li>Mobile Web browsing</li></ol><p>This is a very in­ter­est­ing turn of events for Ap­ple as the com­pany has al­ways sep­a­rated iPhone and Ap­ple Watch as two sep­a­rate de­vices, where you would not use Ap­ple Watch for web brows­ing. Now Ap­ple is ac­tively de­vel­op­ing the tech­nolo­gies right un­der our noses. How­ever the com­pany just doesn’t see the fea­ture as yet ready to be used as a sell­ing point.

Prime Min­is­ter Keir Starmer's warn­ing of "painful" de­ci­sions ahead has sent shock­waves through an in­dus­try that has long been the beat­ing heart of the UK econ­omy. This ar­ti­cle ex­am­ines the po­ten­tial im­pacts on this cru­cial sec­tor and what it could mean for Britain's cov­eted sta­tus as a global fi­nan­cial hub.</p><h3>Titans of the UK Economy: Private Equity and Hedge Funds</h3><p>Be­fore we dive into the loom­ing changes, let's grasp the true mag­ni­tude of this sec­tor's sig­nif­i­cance:</p><ul><li><strong>Job Creation Powerhouse</strong>: Private equity-backed companies employ over 2.2 million people in the UK directly—that's more than the entire population of Paris. With suppliers employing another 1.3 million, this sector influences the livelihoods of 1 in 10 UK workers.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>GDP Goliath</strong>: In 2023, these businesses generated £286 billion in GDP, accounting for 6% of the UK's total. To put this in perspective, that's larger than the entire economy of Finland.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Deal-Making</strong>: Private equity is involved in over a third of all UK business deals. Imagine a chessboard where private equity is moving the most powerful pieces, shaping the future of British business with every move.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Investment Giant</strong>: With approximately £250 billion invested in UK companies, private equity pumps more money into British businesses than the UK spends on defense and education combined.</li></ul><h3>The Storm: Potential Tax Changes and Their Effects</h3><h4>1. The Capital Gains Tax Revolution</h4><p>The in­dus­try's biggest fear is a rad­i­cal over­haul of the cap­i­tal gains tax regime. Cur­rently, car­ried in­ter­est—deeply im­por­tant for fund man­agers—is taxed at a com­fort­able 28% in­stead of the bruis­ing 45% in­come tax rate.</p><p><strong>Po­ten­tial Ef­fects:</strong></p><ul><li>A shift to income tax rates could slash fund managers' take-home pay by up to 30%. This isn't just trimming the fat; it's cutting into the bone of what makes UK private equity tick.</li><li>The UK's allure could dim dramatically. Suddenly, New York's bright lights and Singapore's tax-friendly shores look far more inviting for both funds and talent.</li><li>We could see a domino effect: as fund managers flee, they might take their Rolodexes, their expertise, and their capital with them, potentially unraveling the intricate tapestry of the UK's private equity ecosystem.</li></ul><h4>2. The Non-Dom Dilemma</h4><p>The po­ten­tial abo­li­tion of the UK's non-domiciled ("non-dom") sta­tus is like re­mov­ing a cru­cial Jenga piece from Lon­don's tow­er­ing fi­nan­cial struc­ture.</p><p><strong>Po­ten­tial Ef­fects:</strong></p><ul><li>London's cosmopolitan finance scene could lose its international appeal. The non-dom status has been the secret sauce attracting global financial wizards to the UK.</li><li>There's a multiplier effect to consider: high-earning non-doms aren't just workers; they're investors, luxury consumers, and patrons of high-end services. Their exodus could send ripples far beyond Canary Wharf, affecting everything from high-street retailers to the housing market.</li></ul><h4>3. The Regulatory Reckoning</h4><p>In­creased scrutiny and reg­u­la­tion loom on the hori­zon, po­ten­tially in­clud­ing stricter trans­parency re­quire­ments or lim­its on lever­age.</p><p><strong>Po­ten­tial Ef­fects:</strong></p><ul><li>While transparency sounds good on paper, it could be kryptonite to private equity's superpowers.

The com­pany's strug­gles have cul­mi­nated in its im­pend­ing exit from the FTSE 100 in­dex af­ter a 15-year tenure, mark­ing a stark re­ver­sal of for­tune for the once-thriving fash­ion pow­er­house.</p><p>The scale of Burberry's de­cline is starkly il­lus­trated by its fi­nan­cial per­for­mance. In the fis­cal year end­ing March 30, 2024, Burberry re­ported rev­enue of £2.97 bil­lion, a 4.07% de­crease from the pre­vi­ous year. More alarm­ingly, net in­come plum­meted by 44.90% to £270 mil­lion, re­sult­ing in a net profit mar­gin of just 9.10%, down from 15.84% the pre­vi­ous year. Earn­ings per share (EPS) fell by 39.67% to £0.74, re­flect­ing the com­pany's strug­gling prof­itabil­ity.</p><p>The com­pany's bal­ance sheet also shows signs of strain. Cash and short-term in­vest­ments de­creased by 57.02% to £441 mil­lion, while to­tal as­sets de­clined by 8.57% to £3.37 bil­lion. This liq­uid­ity crunch is fur­ther ev­i­denced by the neg­a­tive net change in cash of £599 mil­lion, a wor­ry­ing 177.31% de­crease from the pre­vi­ous year.</p><p>Burberry's stock mar­ket per­for­mance has been equally dis­mal. The com­pany's share price has fallen by over 50% in 2024, wip­ing out bil­lions in mar­ket cap­i­tal­i­sa­tion. This dra­matic de­cline has led to Burberry's im­pend­ing rel­e­ga­tion from the FTSE 100, a sig­nif­i­cant blow to its sta­tus as a blue-chip com­pany.</p><p>At the heart of Burberry's trou­bles lies a per­fect storm of in­ter­nal mis­steps and ex­ter­nal chal­lenges. The com­pany's am­bi­tious at­tempt to repo­si­tion it­self as a high-fashion lux­ury brand has back­fired, alien­at­ing its core cus­tomer base and fail­ing to at­tract the de­sired ultra-wealthy clien­tele. This strat­egy shift, spear­headed by for­mer cre­ative di­rec­tor Ric­cardo Tisci, saw Burberry mov­ing away from its her­itage prod­ucts like the clas­sic trench coat in favour of more avant-garde de­signs and sig­nif­i­cantly higher price points.</p><p>Fi­nan­cial an­a­lyst Je­lena Sokolova of Morn­ingstar notes, "They tried to be a ma­jor fash­ion player be­cause fash­ion was back in fash­ion. It was the same with boost­ing leather goods. Nei­ther of these things, I would say, are ex­tremely strongly in the brand DNA."</p><p>The num­bers paint a grim pic­ture of Burberry's de­cline. Sales in the first quar­ter of the 2024 fis­cal year fell by 21% year-over-year, prompt­ing the sus­pen­sion of its div­i­dend and the oust­ing of CEO Jonathan Akeroyd af­ter just two years at the helm. This lead­er­ship tur­moil is re­flected in the sub­stan­tial "golden hello" pack­age worth up to £9.2 mil­lion of­fered to new CEO Joshua Schul­man, high­light­ing the com­pany's des­per­ate need for a turn­around.</p><p>Ex­ter­nal fac­tors have also con­tributed to Burberry's woes. The global lux­ury mar­ket is fac­ing head­winds, par­tic­u­larly in China, a cru­cial mar­ket for high-end brands. Burberry re­ported a more than 20% de­cline in sales in main­land China, a trend mir­rored by other lux­ury brands. For con­text, LVMH, the world's largest lux­ury group, saw its sales in Asia (ex­clud­ing Japan) fall by 14% in the sec­ond quar­ter of 2024, while Richemont re­ported a 27% drop in sales in China, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p><p>The com­pany's strug­gles high­light a broader trend of volatil­ity in re­tail stocks, es­pe­cially in the lux­ury sec­tor. Burberry's price-to-book ra­tio of 2.10 and re­turn on as­sets of 7.41% in­di­cate that in­vestors are in­creas­ingly skep­ti­cal about the com­pany's abil­ity to gen­er­ate value from its as­sets.</p><p>In­dus­try ex­perts sug­gest that Burberry's path to re­cov­ery lies in re­turn­ing to its roots. A closer look at the com­pany's prod­uct mix re­veals the ex­tent of its de­vi­a­tion from its core strengths. Out­er­wear, once Burberry's sig­na­ture cat­e­gory, now ac­counts for only 30% of its rev­enue, with the iconic trench coat con­tribut­ing a mere 10%. In con­trast, ap­parel, one of the slowest-growing seg­ments in lux­ury, makes up about 60% of Burberry's sales.</p><p>Adam Cochrane, an an­a­lyst at Deutsche Bank Re­search, ar­gues, "Burberry was try­ing to ex­pand into cat­e­gories and price points where it did not have suf­fi­cient brand de­sir­abil­ity or her­itage." A re­newed fo­cus on iconic prod­ucts like the trench coat and a more ac­ces­si­ble pric­ing strat­egy could help re­build con­sumer trust and brand loy­alty.</p><p>The ap­point­ment of Joshua Schul­man as the new CEO sig­nals a po­ten­tial shift in strat­egy. Schul­man's ex­pe­ri­ence at Coach and Jimmy Choo sug­gests a move to­wards a more bal­anced ap­proach, po­ten­tially po­si­tion­ing Burberry as a "British Coach" – a brand that of­fers lux­ury at more at­tain­able price points.</p><p>As Burberry nav­i­gates this chal­leng­ing pe­riod, its per­for­mance serves as a cau­tion­ary tale for other lux­ury brands. The com­pany's strug­gles un­der­score the im­por­tance of main­tain­ing brand iden­tity while adapt­ing to chang­ing mar­ket con­di­tions. For in­vestors, Burberry's sit­u­a­tion high­lights the in­creas­ing volatil­ity in re­tail stocks, par­tic­u­larly in the lux­ury sec­tor, where brand per­cep­tion and global eco­nomic fac­tors can quickly im­pact fi­nan­cial per­for­mance.</p><p>The com­ing months will be cru­cial for Burberry as it at­tempts to re­gain its foot­ing in the com­pet­i­tive lux­ury mar­ket. With free cash flow de­clin­ing by 47.53% to £274.5 mil­lion, the com­pany's abil­ity to in­vest in its turn­around strat­egy while main­tain­ing fi­nan­cial sta­bil­ity will be closely watched. The suc­cess of its new di­rec­tion un­der Schul­man's lead­er­ship will not only de­ter­mine the fu­ture of this British icon but also pro­vide valu­able in­sights into the evolv­ing dy­nam­ics of the global lux­ury fash­ion in­dus­try.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/technology/2024-09-01-TheLonelyiMac</guid><title>The Lonely iMac</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/technology/2024-09-01-TheLonelyiMac</link><pubDate>Sun, 1 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="youtube">

</div><p>Luke Mi­ani ar­gues that Ap­ple should have a 27 inch iMac in its lineup in or­der to serve the pro­fes­sional crowd. Typ­i­cally the pro­fes­sional crowd has sig­nif­i­cantly big­ger bud­gets to spend on tech­nol­ogy and they have sig­nif­i­cantly dif­fer­ent re­quire­ments for these tools. In the­ory they would value new ad­vances in tech tech­nolo­gies sig­nif­i­cantly above the con­sumer mar­ket be­cause they could hy­po­thet­i­cally make a dif­fer­ence. there have been some sig­nif­i­cant ad­vances in the dis­play tech­nol­ogy how­ever the de­vel­op­ment of com­puter in­ter­nals has sig­nif­i­cantly out­paced with the growth of the dis­play tech­nolo­gies as such this has pro­duced a tech­no­log­i­cal dilemma for Ap­ple. As a very en­vi­ron­men­tally friendly com­pany Ap­ple wants to de­liver the best value to its con­sumers whilst pre­serv­ing the planet.</p><p>There is typ­i­cally two desk­top form fac­tors; one has the dis­play sep­a­rate of the com­puter and the other has a com­puter in­te­grated in the dis­play. Cur­rently there is only one in­te­grated so­lu­tion, the 24 inch iMac. This com­puter does not of­fer any other chip ex­cept the base level con­fig­u­ra­tion also known as an M chip. Sep­a­rately from a dis­play there are two com­put­ers that are of­fered they are Mark stu­dio and Mac mini. Both of these com­put­ers cover the en­tire range of power and use cases. The Mac mini has the base M chip and the M Pro chip, while the Mac Stu­dio has the M Max chip and M ul­tra chip.</p><h3>Why does Apple do this?</h3><p>Ap­ple’s phi­los­o­phy is very sim­ple. They see that they can up­date the dis­plays and com­putes sep­a­rately at dif­fer­ent speeds. Ad­di­tion­ally you can re­place the dis­play with­out re­plac­ing the en­tire com­puter. The setup is sig­nif­i­cantly more mod­u­lar and that is a big ben­e­fit for pro­fes­sional users who care about hav­ing the best dis­play or the best com­puter. Al­ter­na­tively you can get what­ever dis­play you re­quire for the use. For ex­am­ple if you would like to have an OLED panel on the dis­play or the 240 frames re­fresh rate or 32” inch curved panel; you can get that sep­a­rately. At the cost of a lit­tle bit more money.</p><p>Ad­di­tion­ally Ap­ple is very clever about sell­ing you their dis­plays in­de­pen­dently be­cause you can con­nect it to the Mac­Book or iPad, so you don’t nec­es­sar­ily need a sep­a­rate desk­top com­puter. Again it is more con­ve­nient. Their goal with their dis­plays is to pro­vide that are best in class over­all. If this means that one day they de­cide to swap to miniLED or tan­dum OLED you can buy the dis­plays sep­a­rately from the com­puter.</p><p>It is very amaz­ing that now you can use an iPad with an ex­ter­nal mon­i­tor be­cause you can use an ex­ter­nal key­board and mouse or a track­pad or work while hav­ing two dis­plays. For a lot of peo­ple that means they do not need a Mac for their work­flow.</p><h3>Why does iMac still exist then?</h3><p>For the most crowd when you buy an iMac you buy an all in one, but you buy it fore­most be­cause you want to buy a good dis­play with an in built com­puter and not have to worry about buy­ing two sep­a­rate things. <em>”For con­sumers you need sim­plic­ity, for pro­fes­sion­als you need choice”</em> this sen­tence would en­com­pass the phi­los­o­phy that sep­a­rates the two cat­e­gories and the de­ci­sions that are made. This is the rea­son why the iMac ex­ists in one size with one chip. It ex­ists to serve the need of cer­tain con­sumers for this type of de­vice, for every­one else there is Mac <em>pause</em> or iPad and Mac­Book. Portable de­vices are so pow­er­ful right now that the rea­son why the all in one com­puter isn’t be­ing sold is be­cause a lot of the au­di­ence has fun­nelled into other prod­ucts that weren’t pos­si­ble 10 years ago.</p><h3>What is Next?</h3><p>Ap­ple Vi­sion cat­e­gory is ex­plor­ing a new con­cept which is a Vir­tual Dis­play. The fact that you can in­ter­act and make the dis­plays big­ger than ever in Vi­sion OS 2, shows that Ap­ple is lean­ing very heav­ily into the head­set tech­nol­ogy re­plac­ing dis­plays one day through lever­ag­ing the high­est and most dense res­o­lu­tion micro-OLED dis­plays that ex­ist cur­rently at the price which is sig­nif­i­cantly more af­ford­able than Ap­ple Dis­play XDR.</p><p>How­ever for to­day, the qual­ity of the Vir­tual dis­play is lim­ited so it may cater to­wards the au­di­ence that does not care so much about res­o­lu­tion and places the greater em­pha­sis on the fact that they can lever­age the spa­tial com­put­ing to have a lot of win­dows to mul­ti­task while in­creas­ing the size of the dis­play for the Mac plat­form that aren’t com­mer­cially vi­able.</p><p>We have to wait and see what the Vi­sion OS 3 would bring along side the lower price point of the Ap­ple Vi­sion Air.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-30-ComplyingTimes</guid><title>Complying Times: Telegram's IPO Dreams Derailed: Critical Lessons for Investors and Entrepreneurs</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-30-ComplyingTimes</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the fast-paced world of tech star­tups and so­cial me­dia plat­forms, Telegram has long been a ris­ing star, boast­ing nearly an al­leged bil­lion users and grand am­bi­tions for a lu­cra­tive IPO. How­ever, re­cent events sur­round­ing the com­pany and its enig­matic founder, Pavel Durov, serve as a stark re­minder of the po­ten­tial pit­falls in the startup ecosys­tem and the im­por­tance of due dili­gence for in­vestors.</p><h3>The Fall from Grace</h3><p>Telegram's jour­ney from a promis­ing uni­corn to a com­pany in cri­sis of­fers sev­eral key take­aways:</p><ol><li><strong>Regulatory Compliance Matters</strong>: Durov's arrest in France over allegations of inadequate content moderation highlights the critical importance of regulatory compliance. For startups, especially in sensitive areas like social media, adhering to local and international laws is non-negotiable.</li></ol><p><em>Ex­am­ple:</em> Un­like most ma­jor plat­forms, Telegram is not a mem­ber of the Na­tional Cen­tre for Miss­ing and Ex­ploited Chil­dren (NCMEC) or the In­ter­net Watch Foun­da­tion (IWF), both cru­cial for com­bat­ing child sex­ual abuse ma­te­r­ial on­line. This de­ci­sion, likely made to main­tain a hands-off ap­proach to con­tent, has now be­come a sig­nif­i­cant li­a­bil­ity. But it does also raise eye­brows as to why some­one wouldn’t want to ad­here to these, un­less he knew what users used the plat­form for and what could turn away traf­fic.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Financial Repercussions</strong>: The news of Durov's legal troubles sent shockwaves through the financial markets. Telegram's bonds saw a sharp decline, trading at around 87 cents on the dollar, down from 96 cents before the arrest. This underscores how quickly investor sentiment can shift based on regulatory and legal challenges.</li></ol><p><em>Data Point:</em> Telegram's 2023 fi­nan­cial state­ments re­veal rev­enues of $342 mil­lion but an op­er­at­ing loss of $108 mil­lion. The bond price drop fur­ther ex­ac­er­bates the com­pany's fi­nan­cial po­si­tion, po­ten­tially mak­ing fu­ture fundrais­ing more chal­leng­ing and ex­pen­sive.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>IPO Plans in Jeopardy</strong>: Telegram's hopes for a lucrative IPO within two years have been severely impacted. This serves as a reminder that a company's path to going public can be derailed by factors beyond just financial performance.</li></ol><p><em>Con­text:</em> Durov had pre­vi­ously re­buffed in­vest­ment ap­proaches valu­ing Telegram at "$30 billion-plus." The cur­rent sit­u­a­tion not only jeop­ar­dizes these val­u­a­tions but also raises ques­tions about the com­pany's abil­ity to meet the strin­gent reg­u­la­tory re­quire­ments for pub­lic list­ing.</p><p>With so­cial me­dia start ups form­ing more and more every year it’s im­por­tant to note the mis­takes of com­peti­tors. In 2024 there are 35 so­cial me­dia sites with over 100 mil­lion users and this num­ber is not go­ing to stop grow­ing. It’s clear that to make ex­ist in the space peo­ple need to re­alise they have a re­spon­si­bil­ity to its users and both the pub­lic it can af­fect.</p><h3>Lessons for Investors</h3><ol><li><strong>Look Beyond the Numbers</strong>: While Telegram boasted impressive user growth and ambitious financial projections, the underlying issues with content moderation and legal compliance were red flags that savvy investors might have noticed.</li></ol><p><em>In­sight:</em> In­vestors should scru­ti­nize a com­pany's ap­proach to risk man­age­ment and com­pli­ance, not just its growth met­rics. In Telegram's case, its re­fusal to join industry-standard con­tent mod­er­a­tion ini­tia­tives was a telling sign of po­ten­tial fu­ture is­sues.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Understand the Regulatory Landscape</strong>: Investors need to be aware of the regulatory environment in which a company operates, especially for platforms dealing with user-generated content.</li></ol><p><em>Ex­am­ple:</em> The EU's Dig­i­tal Ser­vices Act (DSA) im­poses stricter rules on plat­forms with over 45 mil­lion users. Telegram's opaque re­port­ing of user num­bers (claim­ing "sig­nif­i­cantly fewer than 45 mil­lion" EU users) should have raised con­cerns about po­ten­tial reg­u­la­tory eva­sion.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Leadership Risk</strong>: Telegram's centralized leadership under Durov, while driving rapid innovation, also presents a significant risk. The company's future now hangs in the balance due to legal actions against its founder.</li></ol><p><em>Data Point:</em> Durov claimed Telegram op­er­ates with just "about 30 en­gi­neers," an un­usu­ally small team for a plat­form of its scale. This hyper-centralisation around Durov in­creases the com­pany's vul­ner­a­bil­ity to leadership-related risks.</p><h3>Implications for Entrepreneurs</h3><ol><li><strong>Prioritise Compliance</strong>: As you build your startup, make regulatory compliance a priority from day one. It's easier (and cheaper) to build compliant systems from the ground up than to retrofit them later.</li></ol><p><em>Ac­tion Item:</em> De­velop a com­pli­ance roadmap that evolves with your com­pany's growth. In­clude reg­u­lar au­dits and en­gage with reg­u­la­tory bod­ies proac­tively.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Diversify Leadership</strong>: While visionary founders are crucial, having a strong leadership team can help mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single individual. If there was more people to question Durov’s actions he and telegram may have not had to be in the position it now faces.</li></ol><p><em>Sug­ges­tion:</em> Cre­ate a ro­bust gov­er­nance struc­ture with checks and bal­ances. Con­sider bring­ing in ex­pe­ri­enced ex­ec­u­tives as the com­pany scales to com­ple­ment the founder's vi­sion with op­er­a­tional ex­per­tise.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Transparency is Key</strong>: Telegram's opaque approach to content moderation and user numbers has come under scrutiny. For startups, establishing transparent practices early on can build trust with users, investors, and regulators alike.</li></ol><p><em>Best Prac­tice:</em> Im­ple­ment reg­u­lar, de­tailed trans­parency re­port­ing from the early stages. This not only builds trust but also helps in iden­ti­fy­ing and ad­dress­ing po­ten­tial is­sues be­fore they be­come crit­i­cal. Cre­ate and im­ple­ment sys­tems to flag po­ten­tial il­le­gal ac­tiv­ity.</p><h3>The Bigger Picture</h3><p>Telegram's sit­u­a­tion is a re­minder that in the world of ris­ing star­tups and en­tre­pre­neur­ship, not all high-flying com­pa­nies are built on solid foun­da­tions. It un­der­scores the im­por­tance of know­ing not just where we in­vest our money, but also un­der­stand­ing the eth­i­cal and le­gal im­pli­ca­tions of the plat­forms we use and sup­port.</p><p>As this story un­folds, it will un­doubt­edly pro­vide more lessons for the tech in­dus­try, in­vestors, and en­tre­pre­neurs alike. In an era where so­cial me­dia plat­forms wield im­mense in­flu­ence, the bal­ance be­tween in­no­va­tion, user pri­vacy, and so­cial re­spon­si­bil­ity re­mains a crit­i­cal chal­lenge to nav­i­gate.</p><p>For now, Telegram's IPO dreams seem dis­tant, and its jour­ney serves as a cau­tion­ary tale in the ever-evolving land­scape of tech star­tups and so­cial me­dia gi­ants. It re­minds us that sus­tain­able suc­cess in the tech world re­quires not just in­no­v­a­tive prod­ucts and rapid growth, but also a strong com­mit­ment to eth­i­cal prac­tices, reg­u­la­tory com­pli­ance, and re­spon­si­ble gov­er­nance.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-29-NvidiaAIAmbitions</guid><title>Nvidia's AI Ambitions: Hype, Hope, or Bubble?</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-29-NvidiaAIAmbitions</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tech­nol­ogy is a never slow­ing snow­ball. And AI is its biggest ad­vanc­ing field. In the rapidly evolv­ing land­scape of ar­ti­fi­cial in­tel­li­gence, Nvidia has emerged as a cen­tral fig­ure, its for­tunes closely tied to the AI boom. The com­pany's re­cent earn­ings call has once again thrust it into the spot­light, ig­nit­ing de­bates about the fu­ture of AI and the sta­bil­ity of the tech mar­ket. As Nvidia's fi­nan­cial per­for­mance con­tin­ues to defy ex­pec­ta­tions, we find our­selves at a crit­i­cal junc­ture, pon­der­ing whether we're wit­ness­ing the dawn of a new tech­no­log­i­cal era or the in­fla­tion of a dan­ger­ous bub­ble.</p><h2>The Earnings That Shook Wall Street</h2><p>Nvidia's lat­est fi­nan­cial re­sults are noth­ing short of spec­tac­u­lar. The chip­maker re­ported rev­enues of $30.04 bil­lion for the past quar­ter, a stag­ger­ing 122% in­crease from the same pe­riod last year. This per­for­mance not only beat Wall Street's al­ready sky-high ex­pec­ta­tions of $28.7 bil­lion but also un­der­scored the in­sa­tiable de­mand for AI in­fra­struc­ture.</p><p>How­ever, the mar­ket's re­ac­tion was mixed. De­spite the im­pres­sive num­bers, Nvidia's shares ex­pe­ri­enced a no­table drop in after-hours trad­ing. This para­dox­i­cal re­sponse has fu­elled dis­cus­sions about mar­ket ex­pec­ta­tions, val­u­a­tion con­cerns, and the sus­tain­abil­ity of AI-driven growth.</p><h2>The Bull Case: AI's Transformative Potential</h2><h3>Unprecedented Growth and Demand</h3><p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, paints a pic­ture of un­stop­pable mo­men­tum. "Nvidia achieved record rev­enues as global data cen­tres are in full throt­tle to mod­ernise the en­tire com­put­ing stack with ac­cel­er­ated com­put­ing and gen­er­a­tive AI," he stated dur­ing the earn­ings call. This op­ti­mism isn't un­founded - the com­pany's GPUs have be­come the back­bone of the AI in­fra­struc­ture be­ing built by tech gi­ants like Mi­crosoft, Meta, and Ama­zon.</p><h3>The AI Revolution in Action</h3><p>The sheer scale of in­vest­ment pour­ing into AI de­vel­op­ment sug­gests that ma­jor play­ers see gen­uine, long-term po­ten­tial. Sam Alt­man’s Open AI is set to re­ceive an­other round of fresh fund­ing and will see the com­pa­nies over­all value ex­ceed $100 bil­lion. But many are see­ing Nvidia's suc­cess not as a bub­ble, but as the first tremors of a seis­mic shift in how we com­pute, work, and live. Pro­po­nents ar­gue that we're still in the early stages of AI adop­tion, with ap­pli­ca­tions rang­ing from health­care di­ag­nos­tics to cli­mate mod­el­ling yet to be fully re­alised.</p><h3>A New Paradigm of Computing</h3><p>Sup­port­ers of the AI boom ar­gue that we're wit­ness­ing a fun­da­men­tal shift in com­put­ing par­a­digms. Just as per­sonal com­put­ers and the in­ter­net rev­o­lu­tionised the late 20th cen­tury, AI could be the defin­ing tech­nol­ogy of the com­ing decades. In this con­text, Nvidia's growth is seen as a nat­ural con­se­quence of its po­si­tion at the fore­front of this rev­o­lu­tion. Sim­ply them be­ing one of the biggest and ear­li­est to fa­cil­i­tate this move­ment has caused they’re growth to be what it is. But this boom is so big that now 76% of Nvidia em­ploy­ees are mil­lion­aires and 1 in 3 of those have a net worth of over $20 bil­lion.</p><h2>The Bear Case: Echoes of Past Bubbles</h2><h3>Valuation Concerns and Market Skepticism</h3><p>How­ever, skep­tics see alarm­ing par­al­lels to past tech bub­bles. El­liott Man­age­ment, a promi­nent hedge fund, has gone so far as to de­clare Nvidia is in "bub­ble land." They ar­gue that AI is "over­hyped with many ap­pli­ca­tions not ready for prime time" and that many sup­posed uses are "never go­ing to be cost-efficient, are never go­ing to ac­tu­ally work right, will take up too much en­ergy, or will prove to be un­trust­wor­thy."</p><h3>The Challenges of Sustaining Growth</h3><p>This bear­ish view is bol­stered by Nvidia's re­cent stock per­for­mance. De­spite beat­ing earn­ings ex­pec­ta­tions, shares fell by up to 7% in after-hours trad­ing fol­low­ing the an­nounce­ment. This could in­di­cate that even stel­lar growth may not be enough to jus­tify the com­pany's lofty val­u­a­tion, which briefly touched $3 tril­lion ear­lier this year. But truth be told if Nvidia is Icarus they are far from burn­ing just yet.</p><h3>The AI Productivity Paradox</h3><p>Crit­ics point out that de­spite mas­sive in­vest­ments in AI, we have yet to see cor­re­spond­ing gains in pro­duc­tiv­ity across the broader econ­omy. This echoes the "pro­duc­tiv­ity para­dox" ob­served in the early days of com­put­ing, where in­creased IT in­vest­ment didn't im­me­di­ately trans­late to pro­duc­tiv­ity growth. Skep­tics ar­gue that AI might be fol­low­ing a sim­i­lar pat­tern, with its true im­pact over­es­ti­mated in the short term.</p><h2>The Reality: Navigating Uncertainty</h2><p>The truth, as of­ten is the case, likely lies some­where be­tween these ex­tremes. AI's po­ten­tial to rev­o­lu­tionise in­dus­tries is real, but so are the chal­lenges of im­ple­men­ta­tion, cost, and so­ci­etal im­pact. Nvidia's growth may in­deed mod­er­ate, but that doesn't negate the broader trend to­wards AI adop­tion.</p><h3>Key Factors to Watch</h3><p>Sev­eral fac­tors will be cru­cial to watch in the com­ing months:</p><ol><li><strong>Sustainable Demand</strong>: Will major tech companies continue their AI spending spree, or will we see a pullback? The answer to this question will significantly impact Nvidia's future growth trajectory.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong>: Can Nvidia maintain its dominance as competitors and even its own customers develop rival chips? The company's ability to stay ahead technologically will be critical.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Real-World Impact</strong>: Will we start seeing tangible productivity gains and new applications that justify the massive investments? The translation of AI capabilities into practical, value-generating applications will be a key indicator of the technology's true potential.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>Regulatory Environment</strong>: How will governments worldwide approach AI regulation, and how might this affect the industry's growth? The evolving regulatory landscape could significantly impact the pace and direction of AI development.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>Broader Economic Factors</strong>: How will macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates and global economic growth, affect investment in AI technologies? The broader economic context will play a crucial role in determining the sustainability of the AI boom.</li></ol><h2>The Road Ahead: Balancing Optimism and Caution</h2><p>As we nav­i­gate this com­plex land­scape, it's cru­cial to main­tain a bal­anced per­spec­tive. The AI rev­o­lu­tion, as ex­em­pli­fied by Nvidia's jour­ney, holds im­mense promise but also car­ries sig­nif­i­cant risks.</p><h3>Lessons from History</h3><p>While com­par­isons to the dot-com bub­ble are un­der­stand­able, they may be pre­ma­ture. The AI rev­o­lu­tion is built on more sub­stan­tial tech­no­log­i­cal foun­da­tions and is al­ready show­ing real-world ap­pli­ca­tions. How­ever, the tech in­dus­try's his­tory is re­plete with ex­am­ples of over-exuberance fol­lowed by painful cor­rec­tions. In­vestors and in­dus­try ob­servers would do well to heed these his­tor­i­cal lessons.</p><h3>The Importance of Realistic Expectations</h3><p>As AI con­tin­ues to evolve, it's cru­cial to set re­al­is­tic ex­pec­ta­tions. The tech­nol­ogy's im­pact is likely to be pro­found, but it may not fol­low a lin­ear or pre­dictable path. There will likely be break­throughs and set­backs, pe­ri­ods of rapid ad­vance­ment and plateaus of con­sol­i­da­tion.</p><h2>Conclusion: Cautious Optimism in the Age of AI</h2><p>Nvidia's jour­ney ex­em­pli­fies both the im­mense po­ten­tial and the in­her­ent risks of the AI boom. As we move for­ward, it will be cru­cial to dis­tin­guish be­tween gen­uine in­no­va­tion and spec­u­la­tive ex­cess. The AI rev­o­lu­tion may well be upon us, but its path is likely to be marked by both tri­umphs and chal­lenges.</p><p>In the end, whether we're wit­ness­ing a bub­ble or the birth of a new tech­no­log­i­cal era will only be clear in hind­sight. For now, the wis­est ap­proach may be one of cau­tious op­ti­mism - em­brac­ing AI's po­ten­tial while re­main­ing vig­i­lant to the risks of over-exuberance. As we stand on the cusp of this AI-driven fu­ture, one thing is cer­tain: the jour­ney ahead promises to be as ex­cit­ing as it is un­pre­dictable.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-12-BorrowedProsperity</guid><title>Borrowed Prosperity: The Risks and Rewards of the Yen Carry Trade</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-08-12-BorrowedProsperity</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Au­gust 2024, global fi­nan­cial mar­kets ex­pe­ri­enced a seis­mic shock that orig­i­nated from an un­likely source: a mod­est in­ter­est rate hike by the Bank of Japan. This event brought into sharp fo­cus the out­sized in­flu­ence of the so-called "yen carry trade" on global mar­kets, rais­ing ur­gent ques­tions about whether the world's fi­nan­cial sys­tem has be­come overly de­pen­dent on Japan's mon­e­tary pol­icy.</p><h3>Understanding the Yen Carry Trade</h3><p>At its core, the yen carry trade is a seem­ingly straight­for­ward in­vest­ment strat­egy. In­vestors bor­row money in Japan­ese yen at very low in­ter­est rates, then con­vert that money into other cur­ren­cies to in­vest in higher-yielding as­sets abroad. The profit comes from the dif­fer­ence be­tween the low bor­row­ing costs in Japan and the higher re­turns avail­able else­where.</p><p>For ex­am­ple, in early 2024, an in­vestor could bor­row yen at an in­ter­est rate of about 0.5% and in­vest in U.S. Trea­sury bonds yield­ing around 5.5%. This 5% dif­fer­ence, mi­nus trans­ac­tion costs, rep­re­sents the po­ten­tial profit – all with­out the in­vestor risk­ing their own cap­i­tal.</p><h3>The Scale of the Trade</h3><p>What be­gan as a niche strat­egy has bal­looned into a mas­sive global phe­nom­e­non. An­a­lysts at ING es­ti­mated that cross-border loans from Japan had reached a stag­ger­ing $1 tril­lion by March 2024, hav­ing grown by 20% since 2021. This fig­ure likely un­der­es­ti­mates the true scale of the carry trade, as it doesn't ac­count for de­riv­a­tives and other com­plex fi­nan­cial in­stru­ments used to am­plify these po­si­tions.</p><h3>The Catalyst: Japan's Monetary Policy Shift</h3><p>For over a decade, Japan main­tained ultra-low in­ter­est rates in an at­tempt to stim­u­late its slug­gish econ­omy and gen­er­ate in­fla­tion. This pol­icy cre­ated ideal con­di­tions for the carry trade to flour­ish. How­ever, on July 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan sur­prised mar­kets by rais­ing its tar­get in­ter­est rate on gov­ern­ment bonds from 0.1% to 0.25% and sig­nal­ing fur­ther tight­en­ing ahead.</p><p>While this change might seem mi­nor, it sent shock­waves through global mar­kets. The yen surged nearly 12% against the dol­lar in a mat­ter of days, as in­vestors scram­bled to un­wind their carry trade po­si­tions. This trig­gered a domino ef­fect across as­set classes:</p><ol><li><strong>Japanese stocks</strong> plummeted, with the Nikkei 225 index suffering its second-largest percentage fall in history, dropping 12% in a single day.</li><li><strong>U.S. and European stock markets</strong> experienced significant declines, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 2.6%.</li><li><strong>Emerging market currencies</strong>, often the beneficiaries of carry trade investments, saw sharp sell-offs. The Mexican peso, for instance, slumped 5% against the dollar.</li></ol><h3>The Case for Concern: Arguments That Global Markets Are Too Reliant on the Yen Carry Trade</h3><ol><li><strong>Amplification of Market Moves</strong>: The sheer size of yen carry trade positions means that even small changes in Japanese monetary policy can have outsized effects on global markets. This amplification can lead to excessive volatility and potential market instability.</li><li><strong>Hidden Risks</strong>: Many investors may not fully appreciate their exposure to the yen carry trade. Even those not directly engaged in the strategy can be affected if they hold assets that have been inflated by carry trade flows.</li><li><strong>Distortion of Asset Prices</strong>: The flood of cheap money from Japan may have artificially inflated asset prices in many markets, creating potential bubbles that could burst when the carry trade unwinds.</li><li><strong>Systemic Risk</strong>: The interconnectedness created by the carry trade means that problems in one market can quickly spread to others, potentially threatening global financial stability.</li><li><strong>Moral Hazard</strong>: The consistent availability of cheap yen funding may have encouraged excessive risk-taking among investors, who came to rely on this "easy money" strategy.</li></ol><h3>Counterarguments: The Yen Carry Trade as a Beneficial Market Mechanism</h3><ol><li><strong>Liquidity Provision</strong>: Carry trades can provide valuable liquidity to markets, especially in emerging economies, facilitating investment and economic growth.</li><li><strong>Risk Distribution</strong>: By allowing investors to diversify internationally, the carry trade can help distribute risk more evenly across the global financial system.</li><li><strong>Market Efficiency</strong>: Carry trades can help correct interest rate differentials between countries, potentially leading to more efficient global capital allocation.</li><li><strong>Economic Stimulus</strong>: For Japan, the outflow of capital through carry trades can help weaken the yen, supporting its export-driven economy.</li><li><strong>Sophisticated Risk Management</strong>: Many institutional investors engaging in carry trades employ complex hedging strategies to mitigate risks, potentially reducing systemic vulnerabilities.</li></ol><h3>The Road Ahead: Navigating a Post-Carry Trade World</h3><p>As Japan grad­u­ally nor­mal­izes its mon­e­tary pol­icy, the un­wind­ing of the yen carry trade poses sig­nif­i­cant chal­lenges for global mar­kets. This tran­si­tion is likely to be marked by pe­ri­ods of height­ened volatil­ity and po­ten­tial mar­ket dis­lo­ca­tions.</p><p>Pol­i­cy­mak­ers and reg­u­la­tors face the del­i­cate task of man­ag­ing this un­wind with­out trig­ger­ing a fi­nan­cial cri­sis. Pos­si­ble mea­sures could in­clude:</p><ol><li>Enhanced monitoring of carry trade exposures and related leverage in the financial system.</li><li>Coordinated action among central banks to provide liquidity if needed during periods of market stress.</li><li>Gradual and well-communicated policy changes to allow markets time to adjust.</li></ol><p>For in­vestors, the shift­ing land­scape ne­ces­si­tates a reeval­u­a­tion of strate­gies that may have re­lied, di­rectly or in­di­rectly, on the yen carry trade. This could in­volve:</p><ol><li>Reassessing portfolio risk exposures, particularly to currencies and emerging markets.</li><li>Developing more diverse sources of returns that are less dependent on interest rate differentials.</li><li>Preparing for a potentially more volatile market environment.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion: A Watershed Moment for Global Finance</h3><p>The re­cent mar­ket tur­moil sparked by changes in Japan­ese mon­e­tary pol­icy serves as a wake-up call about the deep in­ter­con­nect­ed­ness of the global fi­nan­cial sys­tem. While the yen carry trade has played a sig­nif­i­cant role in shap­ing mar­ket dy­nam­ics over the past decade, its out­sized in­flu­ence also poses risks.</p><p>As we move for­ward, find­ing a bal­ance be­tween the ben­e­fits of global fi­nan­cial in­te­gra­tion and the need for sta­bil­ity and re­silience will be cru­cial. The un­wind­ing of the yen carry trade may mark the end of an era of easy money and the be­gin­ning of a new, more com­plex chap­ter in global fi­nance.</p><p>Ul­ti­mately, whether the world's re­liance on the yen carry trade is viewed as ex­ces­sive de­pends on how smoothly mar­kets can nav­i­gate the tran­si­tion away from it. This process will likely de­fine the nar­ra­tive of global fi­nan­cial mar­kets for years to come, test­ing the adapt­abil­ity and re­silience of our in­ter­con­nected fi­nan­cial sys­tem.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-07-08-BettingOnGreen</guid><title>Betting on Green: The Hidden Force Driving the Energy Transition</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-07-08-BettingOnGreen</link><pubDate>Mon, 8 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the world grap­ples with the ur­gent need to de­car­bonise, a pow­er­ful but of­ten over­looked force is qui­etly re­shap­ing the fu­ture of en­ergy: pri­vate eq­uity. With tril­lions of dol­lars at their dis­posal and a pen­chant for trans­for­ma­tive in­vest­ments, PE firms are emerg­ing as crit­i­cal play­ers in ac­cel­er­at­ing the global shift to­wards clean en­ergy. How­ever, this trend raises im­por­tant ques­tions about trans­parency, mar­ket dy­nam­ics, and the ul­ti­mate im­pact on our en­ergy land­scape.</p><h3>The Scale of the Challenge - and the Opportunity</h3><p>The en­ergy tran­si­tion rep­re­sents both a mon­u­men­tal chal­lenge and an un­prece­dented in­vest­ment op­por­tu­nity. Ac­cord­ing to the In­ter­na­tional En­ergy Agency, the world needs to in­vest about $4.5 tril­lion an­nu­ally in clean en­ergy by the early 2030s to meet Paris Agree­ment goals - more than dou­ble the $1.8 tril­lion in­vested in 2023. Gov­ern­ment fund­ing and pub­lic mar­kets alone can­not bridge this enor­mous gap.</p><p>En­ter pri­vate eq­uity. Armed with record lev­els of "dry pow­der" - un­spent cash re­serves to­talling $2.63 tril­lion as of April 2024, ac­cord­ing to S&amp;P Global Mar­ket In­tel­li­gence - PE firms are in­creas­ingly turn­ing their at­ten­tion to the en­ergy tran­si­tion. This shift is dri­ven not just by en­vi­ron­men­tal con­cerns, but by the recog­ni­tion of a mas­sive mar­ket op­por­tu­nity.</p><p>The num­bers tell a com­pelling story. In 2018, PE-backed en­ergy tran­si­tion deals in the U.S. to­talled less than $500 mil­lion. By 2023, that fig­ure had sky­rock­eted to $25.9 bil­lion - a stag­ger­ing 7,300% in­crease in just five years. Glob­ally, pri­vate eq­uity and ven­ture cap­i­tal trans­ac­tions in the re­new­able elec­tric­ity sec­tor reached $7.2 bil­lion in 2023, the high­est to­tal in five years.</p><h3>Why PE is Well-Positioned for the Challenge</h3><p>Sev­eral fac­tors make pri­vate eq­uity par­tic­u­larly well-suited to drive the en­ergy tran­si­tion:</p><ol><li><strong>Risk Appetite</strong>: PE firms have a higher tolerance for risk than many public companies, allowing them to embrace new technologies and business models more readily.</li></ol><ol start="2"><li><strong>Patient Capital</strong>: Energy infrastructure projects often require long time horizons to generate returns. PE firms can provide the patient capital needed, especially with the trend towards longer fund lifespans and multi-fund strategies.</li></ol><ol start="3"><li><strong>Operational Expertise</strong>: Many PE firms bring deep industry knowledge and operational skills to help scale and optimise clean energy businesses.</li></ol><ol start="4"><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Freed from the pressures of quarterly earnings reports, PE-backed companies can focus on long-term value creation and navigate the complexities of the energy transition.</li></ol><ol start="5"><li><strong>Financial Firepower</strong>: With massive amounts of capital to deploy, PE firms can make the large-scale investments required to transform energy infrastructure.</li></ol><h3>Key Areas of Focus</h3><p>Pri­vate eq­uity in­vest­ments in the en­ergy tran­si­tion span a wide range of sec­tors. Based on 2022-2023 data, ma­jor cat­e­gories in­clude:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Sector</th><th>Investment (in billions USD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wind, solar, and supporting technologies</td><td>$12.8</td></tr><tr><td>LNG</td><td>$8.0</td></tr><tr><td>Renewable fuels and products</td><td>$4.5</td></tr><tr><td>EV-related technologies</td><td>$3.7</td></tr><tr><td>Battery materials and technology</td><td>$3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Conservation and efficiency technologies</td><td>$3.5</td></tr><tr><td>Carbon management technologies</td><td>$2.9</td></tr><tr><td>Electricity storage</td><td>$1.8</td></tr><tr><td>Nuclear</td><td>$1.7</td></tr><tr><td>Hydrogen production and related technologies</td><td>$1.1</td></tr></tbody></table><p>This di­verse port­fo­lio ap­proach al­lows PE firms to bet on mul­ti­ple path­ways in the en­ergy tran­si­tion, hedg­ing against un­cer­tainty while po­ten­tially cap­tur­ing out­sized re­turns from break­through tech­nolo­gies.</p><h3>The Dark Side of Private Capital?</h3><p>While the in­flux of pri­vate eq­uity into clean en­ergy is largely pos­i­tive for ac­cel­er­at­ing the tran­si­tion, it also raises con­cerns. The opaque na­ture of pri­vate mar­kets means that crit­i­cal data on en­ergy in­vest­ments and de­ploy­ments may be hid­den from pub­lic view, po­ten­tially dis­tort­ing mar­ket fore­casts and lead­ing to cap­i­tal mis­al­lo­ca­tion.</p><p>There's also the risk of cre­at­ing val­u­a­tion bub­bles in the clean tech sec­tor. The flood of PE money chas­ing deals has dri­ven up as­set prices, po­ten­tially set­ting the stage for fu­ture mar­ket cor­rec­tions. While this "froth­i­ness" may in­cen­tivise needed in­fra­struc­ture in­vest­ment in the short term, it could also lead to over­build­ing and in­ef­fi­cien­cies.</p><p>But it’s not a clear path and a sim­ple switch to start be­ing com­pletely green. While pri­vate eq­uity's in­vest­ment in clean en­ergy is largely pos­i­tive, it is im­por­tant to note that the en­ergy tran­si­tion is a com­plex process. Some PE firms, such as KKR, have di­ver­si­fied their port­fo­lios by main­tain­ing in­vest­ments in both re­new­able and con­ven­tional en­ergy sources. Be­tween March 2022 and the end of 2023, KKR sup­ported sev­eral com­pa­nies with a mix of en­ergy as­sets. This strat­egy re­flects the mul­ti­fac­eted na­ture of the tran­si­tion, where tra­di­tional en­ergy sources still play a sig­nif­i­cant role even as the fo­cus on re­new­ables in­creases.</p><h3>Shaping the Future: Geopolitics and Industrial Policy</h3><p>The role of pri­vate eq­uity in the en­ergy tran­si­tion is in­creas­ingly in­ter­twined with gov­ern­ment pol­icy and geopo­lit­i­cal com­pe­ti­tion. The U.S. In­fla­tion Re­duc­tion Act, with its gen­er­ous tax cred­its for clean en­ergy projects, has been a game-changer in at­tract­ing PE in­vest­ment. This has sparked con­cerns in Eu­rope about los­ing out on crit­i­cal en­ergy tran­si­tion in­dus­tries.</p><p>As gov­ern­ments world­wide seek to se­cure their place in the clean en­ergy econ­omy, pri­vate eq­uity be­comes a key mech­a­nism for de­ploy­ing cap­i­tal and scal­ing new tech­nolo­gies. This public-private dance will likely shape the ge­og­ra­phy of the en­ergy tran­si­tion, de­ter­min­ing which coun­tries and re­gions emerge as lead­ers in var­i­ous clean en­ergy sec­tors.</p><h3>The Road Ahead: Promise and Pitfalls</h3><p>Pri­vate eq­uity's grow­ing role in the en­ergy tran­si­tion of­fers both promise and po­ten­tial pit­falls. On the pos­i­tive side, PE firms can pro­vide the cap­i­tal, ex­per­tise, and long-term fo­cus needed to drive trans­for­ma­tive change in our en­ergy sys­tems. Their will­ing­ness to take risks on emerg­ing tech­nolo­gies could ac­cel­er­ate break­throughs in ar­eas like ad­vanced nu­clear, green hy­dro­gen, and next-generation en­ergy stor­age.</p><p>How­ever, the sig­nif­i­cant role of pri­vate cap­i­tal in the en­ergy tran­si­tion brings cer­tain chal­lenges. The pri­vate mar­ket's less trans­par­ent na­ture can some­times make it dif­fi­cult to gather com­pre­hen­sive data, which is cru­cial for ef­fec­tive pol­i­cy­mak­ing. Ad­di­tion­ally, while the pri­mary fo­cus of PE firms is of­ten on fi­nan­cial re­turns, there is a grow­ing recog­ni­tion of the need to bal­ance these with broader so­ci­etal and en­vi­ron­men­tal goals to achieve the best out­comes for the en­ergy tran­si­tion.</p><p>Ul­ti­mately, the im­pact of pri­vate eq­uity on our en­ergy fu­ture will de­pend on how well firms in­te­grate profit mo­tives with the ur­gent need for de­car­bon­i­sa­tion. Reg­u­la­tory frame­works and pub­lic en­gage­ment will be es­sen­tial in guid­ing PE be­hav­iour and en­sur­ing that pri­vate in­vest­ments are aligned with cli­mate ob­jec­tives.</p><p>As we nav­i­gate this crit­i­cal junc­ture in the global en­ergy tran­si­tion, it is clear that pri­vate eq­uity will sig­nif­i­cantly in­flu­ence the speed and di­rec­tion of change. Whether this leads to a cleaner, more sus­tain­able en­ergy sys­tem or presents new chal­lenges will de­pend on var­i­ous fac­tors. What re­mains cer­tain is that un­der­stand­ing and en­gag­ing with the role of PE in the en­ergy tran­si­tion is es­sen­tial for pol­i­cy­mak­ers, in­dus­try lead­ers, and cit­i­zens as we work to­gether to re­shape our en­ergy land­scape for the fu­ture.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-07-03-SoftwareSoldiers</guid><title>Software Soldiers: The VC-Driven Transformation of Modern Security</title><description></description><link>https://groupworks.media/finance/2024-07-03-SoftwareSoldiers</link><pubDate>Wed, 3 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0100</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fu­ture of war­fare is be­ing coded in Sil­i­con Val­ley.

The rise of software-defined war­fare, dri­ven by ven­ture cap­i­tal in­vest­ment, promises rapid ad­vance­ments and un­prece­dented ca­pa­bil­i­ties.

The US gov­ern­ment's For­eign In­vest­ment Risk Re­view Mod­erni­sa­tion Act (FIR­RMA) of 2018 has in­creased scrutiny of for­eign in­vest­ment in crit­i­cal tech­nolo­gies, po­ten­tially lim­it­ing fund­ing sources for some star­tups.</p><p>More­over, the eth­i­cal im­pli­ca­tions of AI-powered weapons sys­tems have led to in­ter­nal con­flicts at tech gi­ants like Google, where em­ployee protests re­sulted in the com­pany's with­drawal from Project Maven, a Pen­ta­gon AI ini­tia­tive, in 2018.</p><p>Nev­er­the­less, the trend of VC in­vest­ment in de­fence tech shows no signs of abat­ing. As geopo­lit­i­cal ten­sions per­sist and the pace of tech­no­log­i­cal change ac­cel­er­ates, the fu­sion of Sil­i­con Val­ley's in­no­va­tion ecosys­tem with the de­fence sec­tor promises to re­shape na­tional se­cu­rity par­a­digms and po­ten­tially al­ter the global bal­ance of power.</p><p>This ven­ture capital-driven trans­for­ma­tion rep­re­sents a par­a­digm shift in mil­i­tary in­no­va­tion, chal­leng­ing long-held as­sump­tions about war­fare and na­tional se­cu­rity.

Be­cause every sin­gle soft­ware up­date from here on­wards is go­ing to be more im­pact­ful to con­sumers than ever be­fore. Ap­ple knows ex­actly what they are do­ing when they roll out an up­date. From the keynote you might think that the watchOS 11 is barely an up­date. How­ever in re­al­ity it is ac­tu­ally quite the op­po­site. Since the ini­tial re­lease of the Ap­ple Watch, Ap­ple has been work­ing on core func­tion­al­ity of the watch and mak­ing it less re­liant on the iPhone for its core func­tion­al­ity, not to men­tion set­ting it up and con­fig­ur­ing it through the iPhone app. Ac­cord­ing to leaks and pub­lic doc­u­ments, Ap­ple once dis­cussed bring­ing the Ap­ple Watch app to An­droid. I am will­ing to bet they dis­cussed bring­ing to other Ap­ple de­vices as well. How­ever the con­clu­sion that they came to is that it is not worth while in the long run to main­tain a dis­tri­b­u­tion of this app on many plat­forms when even­tu­ally they aim to make the Ap­ple Watch a fully in­de­pen­dent prod­uct.</p><p>No mat­ter what new Ap­ple Watch comes out they have to work with the cur­rent and pre­vi­ous sup­ported gen­er­a­tions of Ap­ple Watches. This means choos­ing what fea­tures come and don’t come to each gen­er­a­tion. It is re­ally great that Ap­ple cares so much for main­tain­ing older gen­er­a­tions, but does it hin­der the po­ten­tial of the cur­rent gen­er­a­tion be­fore a new one is re­leased? Over­all watchOS 11 is the strongest re­lease of the soft­ware thus far. At the mo­ment of writ­ing this I read that Siri face has been dis­con­tin­ued, which hurts, be­cause that is what I have been us­ing since I got Ap­ple Watch se­ries 2 as a hand down dur­ing the pan­demic to re­place the aw­ful Fit­bit that I had. In short the ex­pe­ri­ence I had with that watch got to me to wait and up­grade to the Ap­ple Watch Se­ries 7 Cel­lu­lar. I was so blown away by the func­tion­al­ity I de­cided to try us­ing it in­stead of my iPhone and it proved to be re­ally fun. I will write more about this in an­other post as it would make this post too long.</p><p>The biggest fac­tor at play is Hard­ware. Es­pe­cially from a soft­ware per­spec­tive a tech­nol­ogy be­comes only pos­si­ble when we get in­no­va­tions in the hard­ware. What hap­pens when you have lim­i­ta­tions in the hard­ware? You have to make de­ci­sions that look at the main ob­jec­tives of the prod­uct and a de­ci­sion has to an­swer a few ques­tions no­tably:</p><ul><li>Will this compromise core features/functionality?</li><li>Will this be useful to the user?</li><li>How will this combine with other established features?</li></ul><p>Let’s be­gin with Hard­ware. Ap­ple Watch is lim­ited in terms of hard­ware space that it can use due to its in­ter­nal case space. Firstly, the biggest is­sue stems from the watch size, if you scale a prod­ucts size, you will scale the in­ter­nal size along side it. Sec­ondly, the space taken up by the strap mech­a­nism when you see that it is on both sides of the case. Un­til Ap­ple puts dou­ble sided logic boards into pro­duc­tion on the Ap­ple Watch we will be con­strained by the length and width of the in­ter­nal space.</p><p>Cur­rently Ap­ple Watch lineup con­sists of 3 sizes which means it is hard to make one SiP (Sys­tem in Pack­age) for all of them that takes ad­van­tage of the in­ter­nal space of the big­ger watches.</p><h3>Why is the size of the SiP so important?</h3><p>The big­ger the SiP dye the more ad­di­tional tran­sis­tors you can fit on it. This al­lows you to add more cores on the CPU, GPU and the Neural en­gine. Ad­di­tion­ally, you have more space for RAM and SSD, which means they can be big­ger and store more things. Size of RAM is more im­por­tant as it con­tributes to mul­ti­task­ing abil­i­ties and dic­tates what the data bot­tle­neck is, in other terms how much data can be processed all at once.</p><h3>What do the extra cores / transistors allow SiP to do?</h3><p>Cur­rently Ap­ple Watch has a two core CPU and a sin­gle core GPU, which means that it has a very lim­ited num­ber of par­al­lel processes that can hap­pen at once given its ar­chi­tec­ture of RISC as li­censed by ARM, while be­ing de­signed by Ap­ple and pro­duced by TSMC. The Ap­ple Watch dye is based of a cut down iPhone SoC that they fit all the com­po­nents as close to­gether as pos­si­ble to fit it into such a minia­ture in­ter­nal space. Mul­ti­task­ing fea­tures come from hav­ing mul­ti­ple cores to rely on. This is why Ap­ple Watch cur­rently has lim­ited mul­ti­task­ing fea­tures.<br /><br />### How will Ap­ple solve this prob­lem? Ap­ple when un­veil­ing their new line up of Ap­ple Watches in the Sep­tem­ber of 2024, will show that they have elim­i­nated the small­est model size, while ad­di­tion­ally re­work­ing the strap at­tach­ment mech­a­nism. This will al­low it to cut down less on the iPhone SoC due to more avail­able space, which will al­low it to have more cores thereby be­ing able to per­form more op­er­a­tions all at once. This all con­tributes to more func­tion­al­ity in the soft­ware.</p><h3>Are there any alternatives?</h3><p>They could make SiPs that are dou­ble sided but that would be too ex­pen­sive for com­mer­cial pro­duc­tion and will not yield the quan­ti­ties re­sult that are ex­pected for the Ap­ple Watch sales.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
