Taiwan is a vastly diverse place and contains multitudes packed into 36,000 km2. Taiwan was the first country in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage and is consistently ranked as the top Asian country in the FI Human Freedom Index. I left Taiwan when I was 8 years old having spent my early primary school years here, but to get the chance to return has been an opportunity for re-discovery and learning. Coming back 12 years later, I can see Taiwan through a new lens to fully understand and appreciate this often misunderstood place.</p><p>One of the first questions my friends had when I told them I was moving to Taiwan for a year was “What would happen if Taiwan was invaded while you are there?” - I’d leave. It is because of that fact I don’t feel qualified to talk too much about life in Taiwan in context with China because I can pack up and return to my safe home. I cannot understand what it is like to have your safety feel temporary, or maybe it doesn’t feel temporary to Taiwanese people, I wouldn’t know because I am not Taiwanese. So, I want to hopefully change people’s initial thoughts on Taiwan. I want to show you the Taiwan I know.</p><p>A brief history of Taiwan: Taiwan used to be connected to what is now mainland China by a natural land bridge, however as that disappeared the people on the island of Formosa (Taiwan) were cut off from continental Asia. They began exploring other Pacific islands and, as a result, most Polynesian aboriginal peoples are descendants of the Austronesian Taiwanese population. In the early 1600s, The Dutch East India Company set up in southern Formosa and Spanish colonial missions settled in the north. The Chinese Ming dynasty fought the Europeans out of Formosa before being replaced by Qing dynasty settlers who claimed the island as a Qing province in the late 1800s. Following the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was then colonised by the Japanese Empire. The Republic of China was established on the mainland and took over the Qing dynasty. By 1948, China was engaged in a civil war between the RoC (Chiang Kai-Shek’s Party) and the CCP (Mao ZeDong’s Party) before the RoC retreated to Taiwan. Taiwan was run as a harsh dictatorship under Chiang Kai-Shek until martial law ended in 1987.</p><p>In August I moved from London to Taipei, making the jump to live in a foreign country on my own for the first time. It was daunting but never scary. I was slightly familiar with Taipei and knew how friendly Taiwanese people are, especially to foreigners who might look a bit lost. That certainly hasn’t changed. I think when I leave, the story I will tell to convey how warm and welcoming Taiwanese people are will be: My friend recently broke his foot and is on crutches, his flimsy raincoat does very little to protect him from the tropical rain, yet he found that so many people were willing to share their umbrella over him as he cautiously crutches in the rain - he doesn’t know these strangers and they don’t make a big fuss about it, they just see someone in need of help and jump to shelter him from the rain, if only for a little while. Obviously, his experience as a blonde-haired blue-eyed foreigner does grant him some benefits, but we both lament that this would never happen in London. Another friend was being chased down the street by a man shouting after him - the man followed him the length of the street just to return the money my friend had dropped at the ATM. On the MRT (subway/tube system in Taipei) no one would be caught dead sitting on the priority seats, even if the train is crammed. I am always thinking ‘oh, this would never happen in London’ - constantly heartened by the care people have for others.</p><img src="/images/Taiwan/TraditionalRoofTiles.jpg"/><p>Taipei is, by far, the most environmentally conscious city I have ever lived in. Taiwan’s recycling rate is an astonishing 55% (the highest in the world). Previously Taiwan just collected and burned its rubbish, however, the Homemakers United group went to the EPA and brought about a massive change in the Taiwanese rubbish system. In Taipei, 5 nights a week the rubbish truck comes to your local designated spot blasting Für Elise so that everyone in the area knows to come and take out their rubbish. Following the yellow truck is a smaller white truck for recycling with separate days for plastic, paper, glass, and compostable waste collection. Taiwan is well on its way to meeting its promise to ban all single-use plastics by 2030 - when the ban on single-use plastic cups was announced in July this year, by the finalisation of the policy single-use plastic cups had already been reduced by 17%. Taipei itself is surrounded on all sides by mountains, encouraging you to explore and embrace your relationship with nature from just a few MRT stops away. Taipei is an incredibly walkable city, and just a quick wander around will show how connected people are to nature as every balcony resembles its own mini-forest.</p><p>I think the most glaringly obvious difference between Taipei and London is the care people put into public infrastructure. The MRT is almost 100% step-free and accessible across the whole system and music plays and lights flash to alert you of the train arriving train for better accessibility and inclusivity. Everyone respects the no food and drink signs on the MRT and its cleanliness has made me realise how truly grotty TFL can be. The streets are so clean, which seems unlikely as you’d be hard-pressed to find a bin anywhere. Instead, people take their rubbish home with them for it to be properly disposed of and prevent overflowing public bins. Outside most shops and restaurants, there are little stands to leave your wet umbrella on. People can do this because they don’t want to dirty the shop and they trust that no one is going to steal it. In cafes, people leave all their belongings at their table while they go to the toilet or for a smoke because it is safe. But most importantly, I have never felt so safe walking home alone at night. There is an emphasis on consideration for strangers and creating the space for others that you want for yourself.</p><p>I want to share with the rest of the world the Taipei that I know. Whilst most people might immediately think of war or tensor chips when the topic of Taiwan comes up, I think of the care everyone has for the infrastructure, the environment, and the people around them. I hope that when I return to London, I can bring back a deeper care for the community around me and a renewed understanding of the need for environmental protection, in both the natural world and for our shared public services.</p><h5>Sources:</h5><p><style>.wrapper a[href*="www.fraserinstitute.org"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.fraserinstitute.org);}</style><a href="https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/human-freedom-index-2022.pdf">Fraser Institute</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="rapidtransition.org"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=rapidtransition.org);}</style><a href="https://rapidtransition.org/stories/taiwans-transition-from-garbage-island-to-recycling-leader/">Rapid Transition</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.sustainableplastics.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.sustainableplastics.com);}</style><a href="https://www.sustainableplastics.com/news/taiwan-finalise-single-use-plastic-cups-ban-september">Sustainable Plastics</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.taiwan.gov.tw"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.taiwan.gov.tw);}</style><a href="https://www.taiwan.gov.tw/content_3.php">Taiwan Governement</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.theguardian.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.theguardian.com);}</style><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/02/after-hong-kong-china-taiwan-invasion-armed-forces">The Guardian</a> <style>.wrapper a[href*="www.aljazeera.com"]{background-image: url(https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=www.aljazeera.com);}</style><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/longform/2024/5/25/fearing-war-with-china-civilians-in-taiwan-prepare-for-disaster-2">Aljazeera</a></p></div><span>Tagged with: </span><ul class="tag-list"><li><a href="/tags/elizabeth-elrick">Elizabeth Elrick</a></li><li><a href="/tags/politics">politics</a></li><li><a href="/tags/taiwan">Taiwan</a></li></ul></article></div><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script src="/disqus.js"></script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the comments</noscript></body><body><footer><p><span>Copyright Group Works. </span><span>All rights reserved</span></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
