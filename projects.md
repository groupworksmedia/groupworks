# Flavour 

I am working to bring project Flavour to life. I work towards bringing high tech technologies to the bespoke market with onsite design and manufacture under one roof within central London. Technology allows us to bring clothing that is unique and one of one. This is a much more personal approach.

I am working to:
- Create state-of-the-art knitting machines
- Develop design software using Swift frameworks and embed machine learning throughout.
- Source high-quality knit

If you can help with any of these please get in touch!

The website's [Flavour Boutique](http://flavour.boutique) server is up and running, however the website is still under active development.
