In a landmark moment for the European tech ecosystem, London-based venture capital titan Atomico has shattered records with its latest fundraise, securing an unprecedented $1.24 billion across two new funds. This monumental achievement not only underscores the resilience of the European VC landscape but also signals a seismic shift in the global tech industry, positioning Europe as a formidable contender on the world stage.

### A Strategic Dual-Fund Approach: Nurturing Innovation from Seed to IPO

Atomico's visionary fundraising strategy splits its new capital between two complementary funds:

1. **Atomico Growth VI**: A whopping $754 million dedicated to propelling companies from Series B to pre-IPO stages, addressing a critical funding gap in the European ecosystem.
2. **Atomico Venture VI**: A robust $485 million early-stage fund, primarily targeting Series A investments while maintaining flexibility for exceptional seed opportunities.

This dual-fund approach represents a holistic vision for supporting European tech, ensuring a continuous pipeline of support from nascent startups to industry-defining unicorns. By covering the entire spectrum of a company's growth journey, Atomico is positioning itself as the ultimate partner for ambitious European founders.

### Empowering Europe's Tech Visionaries: A Founder-First Philosophy

Niklas Zennström, the legendary entrepreneur behind Skype and founder of Atomico, articulates the firm's mission with characteristic insight: "European technology is coming of age. Meeting this opportunity requires ambition, hustle, and commitment from founders, who need investors with the experience and perspective to see beyond market cycles."

Zennström's words resonate deeply within the tech community, highlighting Atomico's unique position as a VC firm founded by entrepreneurs, for entrepreneurs. This founder-centric approach, combined with Atomico's vast resources and network, creates an unparalleled support system for Europe's most promising tech innovators.

### A Legacy of Success: From Startup to Unicorn

Atomico's faith in European tech is far from blind optimism – it's grounded in a track record of phenomenal success. With a portfolio spanning over 155 ambitious teams across 15 European countries, Atomico has consistently demonstrated its ability to identify and nurture world-changing ideas. The numbers speak for themselves: an astounding 1 in 6 of Atomico's portfolio companies has achieved unicorn status, valued at over $1 billion.

This impressive hit rate includes early investments in fintech revolutionaries like Klarna and Stripe, as well as groundbreaking companies across various sectors. Atomico's golden touch has not only generated exceptional returns but has also played a crucial role in shaping the European tech landscape.

### Investing in Tomorrow: A Glimpse into the Future of Tech

The new funds have already made significant inroads, with 21 investments across cutting-edge sectors that promise to define the future of technology:

- **AI and Machine Learning**: Zurich-based Lakera is pushing the boundaries of AI security, while Oslo's Strise is revolutionising enterprise intelligence with its AI-powered platform.
- **Health Tech**: Stockholm's Neko Health is reimagining preventive healthcare with full-body scans, and Copenhagen's Corti is leveraging AI to save lives in emergency medical situations.
- **Enterprise Software**: Berlin's Deeploi is streamlining IT operations for SMEs, and London's Dexory is transforming warehouse management with robotics and AI.
- **Fintech**: London's Ben (thanks ben) is pioneering new frontiers in employee benefits and financial wellness.

These investments not only showcase Atomico's commitment to diverse and innovative startups but also highlight the firm's focus on technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries.

### The Renaissance of European Tech: A Global Perspective

Atomico's record-breaking fundraise comes at a pivotal moment for the European tech ecosystem. Recent data reveals a seismic shift in the global innovation landscape, with Europe now securing nearly 30% of global early-stage funding and outpacing other regions in new company creation.

This trend, coupled with Atomico's significant new funds, paints a picture of a European tech scene that's not just catching up to traditional powerhouses like Silicon Valley – it's charting its own course and, in many ways, leading the charge in key sectors.

### Beyond Capital: Building a Sustainable Tech Ecosystem

Atomico's impact extends far beyond mere financial investment. The firm has been instrumental in building a robust support system for European tech:

- **Talent Pipeline**: Through initiatives like the Atomico Angels programme, the firm is cultivating the next generation of tech leaders and investors.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Atomico's annual "State of European Tech" report has become the gold standard for understanding the ecosystem's health and trends.
- **Policy Advocacy**: The firm actively engages with policymakers to create a more favourable environment for tech innovation and entrepreneurship across Europe.

These efforts contribute to a flywheel effect, where success breeds more success, attracting global talent and capital to the European tech scene.

### A Bright Horizon: The Future of European Tech

As we look to the future, Atomico's latest move positions the firm – and by extension, the entire European tech ecosystem – to capitalize on emerging opportunities and drive the next wave of technological breakthroughs. From artificial intelligence and quantum computing to climate tech and space exploration, European startups are at the forefront of innovation, backed by visionary investors like Atomico.

The message is clear: Europe's tech scene is not just surviving – it's thriving, innovating, and ready to take centre stage in the global tech narrative. With Atomico's continued support and record-breaking funds, we can expect to see a new generation of European tech giants emerging, solving global challenges, and reshaping industries on a worldwide scale.

As we stand on the brink of this new era, one thing is certain – the future of tech is not just in Silicon Valley; it's being written right here in Europe, with Atomico holding the pen. For entrepreneurs, investors, and tech enthusiasts alike, there has never been a more exciting time to be part of the European tech story. The best, it seems, is yet to come.
