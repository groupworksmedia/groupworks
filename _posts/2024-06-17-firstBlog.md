My experience with setting up a blog has not been the easiest. For anyone looking to set up their own blog I would not necessarily recommend the way that I have chosen, but it depends on what your objective is. 

I have used GitHub pages to set up and host it this very blog on. This means that my blog while limited to 1 GB in total will likely not exceed that for the foreseeable future. This is just enough time to set up my own servers and host personal and professional files there. There are plenty of guides on how to do it. I read a few when writing this blog post. As for me I just stumbled through the whole way, figuring it out myself the entire way. If you are interested check out their resources and documentation on this page about [GitHub Page](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

What some are unsure about and other might find incredible is the fact that you can create anything on GitHub Pages. For those who would like to code or show off their skills, this is a great way to do it. Plus everyone should at the very least try it. The key to doing it successfully is setting ourself up with appropriate resource not pull your hair out, also *read the documentation*.
